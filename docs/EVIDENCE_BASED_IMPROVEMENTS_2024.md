## 1. Updated Orthopedic Test Accuracy (2024 Evidence)

### Shoulder Tests - December 2024 Systematic Review

**Source:** BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, December 2024
**Studies:** 20 studies, 3,438 patients

#### Novel High-Accuracy Tests Added:

| Test | Sensitivity | Specificity | Evidence Level | Indication |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **External Rotation Lag Sign at 90°** | 84% | 92% | STRONG | Rotator cuff tear |
| **Internal Rotation Lag Sign** | 56% | 94% | STRONG | Subscapularis tear |
| **Bear Hug Test** | 57% | 92% | MODERATE | Subscapularis tear |
| **Hornblower's Sign** | 32% | 96% | MODERATE | Teres minor/Infraspinatus tear |
| **Full Can Test** | 70% | 81% | MODERATE | Supraspinatus pathology |

#### Updated Existing Tests:

| Test | Previous | 2024 Update | Change |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Jobe's Test (Empty Can) | 50% / 87% | 88% / 62% | Increased sensitivity |
| Hawkins-Kennedy | - | 80% / 50% | Evidence confirmed |
| Neer's Test | - | - | Low specificity confirmed |

**Clinical Significance:**
- External Rotation Lag Sign at 90° has **highest diagnostic odds ratio** for rotator cuff tears
- Lag signs (ER, IR) more specific than pain-provocation tests
- Test combinations recommended over single tests

### Lumbar Spine Tests - 2024 Evidence Update

**Source:** Multiple systematic reviews (2020-2024)

| Test | Sensitivity | Specificity | Key Finding |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Straight Leg Raise (SLR)** | 91% | 26% | High sensitivity, low specificity |
| **Crossed SLR** | 29% | 90% | High specificity for disc herniation |
| **Passive Lumbar Extension (PLE)** | 84% | 90% | **Best test for instability** |
| **Prone Instability Test (PIT)** | 71% | 57% | Moderate accuracy |
| **Femoral Nerve Stretch** | 100% | 83% | Excellent for L2-L4 radiculopathy |

**Clinical Application:**
- SLR has **positive likelihood ratio 8.84** when combined with other findings
- Over-reliance on single tests inappropriate - use test clusters
- PLE Test shows highest accuracy for lumbar instability

### Knee Tests - Evidence Summary

| Test | Sensitivity | Specificity | Clinical Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Lachman's Test** | 85-95% | 85-94% | **Gold standard for ACL tears** |
| **McMurray's Test** | 61% | 84% | Very specific, low sensitivity for meniscal tears |
| **Joint Line Tenderness** | 76% | 50% | Sensitive but not specific |

**Evidence Note:** Lachman's test remains most accurate single test for ACL integrity.

## 2. Red Flags Screening System (2024 Guidelines)

### Comprehensive Framework Implementation

**Source:** Systematic Review of Clinical Practice Guidelines (2024)
**Coverage:** 114 red flags across 6 major pathology categories

### Red Flag Categories Implemented:

#### 1. **FRACTURE (17 red flags)**
- Age >50 or >65 years
- Significant trauma (fall, MVA)
- Prolonged corticosteroid use
- Osteoporosis history
- **Canadian C-Spine Rule** integration

#### 2. **CANCER (21 red flags)**
- History of cancer (especially breast, lung, prostate, kidney, thyroid)
- Unexplained weight loss >10 lbs
- Age >50 with new onset pain
- Severe night pain unrelieved by rest
- No improvement with conservative care

#### 3. **SPINAL INFECTION (14 red flags)**
- Fever >38°C (100.4°F)
- IV drug use history
- Recent spinal procedure/surgery
- Immunocompromised status (HIV, diabetes, immunosuppressants)
- Persistent severe pain

#### 4. **CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME (High Priority)**
- **Bowel/bladder dysfunction** ⚠️ EMERGENCY
- **Saddle anesthesia** ⚠️ EMERGENCY
- Progressive bilateral leg weakness
- Urinary retention/incontinence
- Loss of anal sphincter tone

#### 5. **MYELOPATHY (15 red flags)**
- Gait disturbance (wide-based, unsteady)
- Positive Hoffman's sign
- Clonus (ankle, patella)
- Hyperreflexia
- Bilateral symptoms
- Hand clumsiness

#### 6. **ARTERY DISSECTION (7 red flags)**
- Sudden severe headache ("thunderclap")
- Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis)
- Recent neck trauma/manipulation

### Evidence-Based Interpretation:

| Finding | Action Required | Timeline |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **High significance red flag** | Immediate medical referral | Same day |
| **Moderate significance + cluster** | Urgent referral | Within 24-48h |
| **Single moderate red flag** | Close monitoring, consider imaging | 1-2 weeks |
| **Low significance alone** | Document, reassess at follow-up | Next visit |

### Important Clinical Notes:

1. **Low Individual Accuracy:** Few red flags have high diagnostic accuracy when used in isolation
2. **Clusters Are Key:** Combinations of red flags show better predictive value
3. **Evidence Level:** Most red flags based on expert opinion rather than high-quality research
4. **False Positives:** Expect many false positives - clinical judgment essential
5. **Exception:** **Canadian C-Spine Rule** has strong evidence for post-traumatic fractures

## 3. Evidence-Based Test Clusters

### Clinical Research Finding:
*"Combinations of orthopedic tests demonstrate better diagnostic accuracy than single tests"*

### Implemented Test Clusters:

#### **Cervical Radiculopathy Cluster**
- Spurling's Test
- Cervical Distraction Test
- Slump Test

**Interpretation:** 2+ positive tests → High likelihood of nerve root compression
**Evidence:** Sensitivity 85%, Specificity 78%

#### **Rotator Cuff Tear Cluster**
- External Rotation Lag Sign at 90°
- Drop Arm Test
- Hornblower's Sign

**Interpretation:** ≥1 lag sign → High specificity for full-thickness tear
**Evidence:** Sensitivity 68%, Specificity 95%

#### **Lumbar Instability Cluster**
- Passive Lumbar Extension Test
- Prone Instability Test

**Interpretation:** Both positive → Clinical instability likely
**Evidence:** Sensitivity 72%, Specificity 82%

#### **SI Joint Dysfunction Cluster**
- Gaenslen's Test
- Thigh Thrust (P4)
- SI Distraction Test
- SI Compression Test
- FABER Test

**Interpretation:** ≥3 of 5 positive → SIJ dysfunction probable
**Evidence:** Sensitivity 85%, Specificity 79%

## 4. Functional Movement Screen (FMS) Integration

### Background:
FMS is a screening tool (not diagnostic) that identifies movement limitations and asymmetries in 7 fundamental patterns.

### FMS Tests Added to System:

1. **Deep Squat** - Overall mobility and stability
2. **Hurdle Step** - Stride mechanics, stability, balance
3. **Inline Lunge** - Hip, knee, ankle mobility/stability
4. **Shoulder Mobility** - Bilateral shoulder ROM
5. **Active Straight Leg Raise** - Hamstring/gastroc flexibility
6. **Trunk Stability Push-Up** - Core stability
7. **Rotary Stability** - Multi-plane stability

### Scoring System:
- **3 points:** Performs correctly without compensation
- **2 points:** Completes with compensation
- **1 point:** Unable to perform pattern
- **0 points:** Pain during movement

### Risk Assessment:
- Score **≥14/21** = Low injury risk
- Score **<14/21** = Elevated injury risk
- **Pain (score 0)** = Requires medical clearance before training

### Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA)
Added for patients **with pain** - uses same movements diagnostically to identify dysfunctional patterns.

- Scale: 0-10 (0 = No pain, 10 = Worst imaginable pain)
- **MCID (Minimal Clinically Important Difference):** 2.0-2.5 points
- **MDC (Minimum Detectable Change):** 2.6-4.1 points
- **Test-Retest Reliability:** ICC 0.58-0.93
- **Compliance:** Superior to VAS in 15/19 studies

#### Templates Added:
1. **Current Pain (NPRS)**
2. **Best/Worst/Average Pain (24h)**
3. **Pain with Activity**
4. **Pain at Rest**
5. **Pain Interference Scale** (0-10 functional impact)

### Evidence-Based Scoring Interpretation:

| Score | Classification | Clinical Significance |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| 0 | No pain | - |
| 1-3 | Mild pain | Usually managed with OTC medications |
| 4-6 | Moderate pain | May require prescription medications |
| 7-9 | Severe pain | Significant functional impact |
| 10 | Worst imaginable pain | Emergency evaluation may be needed |

### Clinical Use:

## QUALITY IMPROVEMENT GUIDELINES

### What Makes Good Clinical Notes:

1. **COMPLETENESS**
   - All relevant sections included
   - Red flags addressed
   - Safety assessment documented
   - Clear clinical reasoning

2. **CLARITY**
   - Use full words for critical information
   - Abbreviations only for standardized terms
   - Patient's own words for chief complaint
   - Specific location descriptions (not just "vondt" = pain)

3. **CONSISTENCY**
   - Same format for all similar note types
   - Standardized abbreviations
   - Consistent terminology
   - Regular use of scales (0-10 pain, 0-5 strength)

4. **CLINICAL REASONING**
   - Link findings to diagnosis
   - Explain treatment choices
   - Document why certain tests were/weren't performed
   - Note response to previous treatments

5. **MEASURABILITY**
   - Specific measurements (degrees, centimeters, scales)
   - Objective outcomes
   - Progress tracking
   - Functional improvements

6. **LEGAL/PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS**
   - Document informed consent
   - Note contraindications ruled out
   - Safety assessments
   - Referrals when appropriate

### Common Issues to Avoid:

❌ **Too Brief:** "beh cx mob"
✅ **Better:** "Treatment: Cervical mobilization supine position, focusing on C5-C6 restriction"

❌ **Vague:** "vondt i ryggen"
✅ **Better:** "Sharp pain (7/10) in right lower lumbar region, worse with forward flexion"

❌ **Missing Safety:** [No mention of red flags]
✅ **Better:** "Red flags screened negative. No cauda equina symptoms, no progressive neurological deficit."

❌ **No Clinical Reasoning:** [Just lists treatment]
✅ **Better:** "Hypomobility at T5 and right-sided muscle spasm suggest facet restriction. Applied SMT with good response."

```

### AFTER (Improved):
```
Date: 2024-09-09
Practitioner: Sigrun Låg Kleiv
Visit: Follow-up #3

SUBJECTIVE:
Patient reports left leg pain persists since last visit. Pain 5/10, located in anterior left lower leg. No radiation below ankle. Feels better with rest, worse with walking >20 minutes. Sleeping well.

OBJECTIVE:
Palpation: Tenderness anterior tibialis and medial tibia left (moderate). Right side unremarkable.
ROM: Full ankle dorsi/plantarflexion bilateral
Muscle testing: 5/5 bilateral lower extremities
Special tests: Negative for DVT signs

ASSESSMENT:
Muscle strain/overuse anterior compartment left lower leg. Improving but not resolved. Secondary upper cervical and thoracic restrictions likely related to altered gait compensation.

TREATMENT:
1. Dry needling: Anterior tibialis and medial tibia bilateral
2. SMT: C5 PLS, C2 PRS
3. Cervical mobilization supine position
4. Trigger point therapy: Right trapezius, right paraspinal cervical muscles, right rhomboid
5. SMT: T5, T8 PLS
6. Mobilization: Levator scapulae bilateral
7. Sacral adjustment: Drop technique posterior
8. Trigger point therapy: Gluteus medius bilateral
9. Joint mobilization: Ankles bilateral, wrists bilateral

PLAN:
Continue current treatment plan. Patient to reduce walking distance until pain <3/10. Next visit in 1 week. Advised to contact if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.

Safety Note: No neurological deficits. No signs of compartment syndrome. Local musculoskeletal dysfunction, no contraindications to treatment.

## METADATA FOR AI TRAINING

Each note should include metadata tags:

```
presentation_type: [acute, chronic, recurrent]
body_region: [cervical, thoracic, lumbar, extremity]
severity: [mild, moderate, severe]
neurological_involvement: [yes, no]
treatment_response: [excellent, good, fair, poor, adverse]
red_flags: [present, absent]
complexity: [simple, moderate, complex]
special_population: [pregnant, elderly, athlete, pediatric, none]
```

This enables AI to learn patterns based on these categories.

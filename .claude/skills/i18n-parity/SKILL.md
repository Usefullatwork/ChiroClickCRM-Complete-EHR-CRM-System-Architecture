# i18n Parity Check

Audit all locale files for translation completeness and consistency.
Adapt locale paths to the specific project structure.

## Step 1: Load Locale Files

Read all JSON files from all locale directories. Typical structures:

- `src/i18n/locales/{lang}/*.json` (namespace-per-file)
- `src/locales/{lang}.json` (single-file)
- `public/locales/{lang}/*.json` (next-i18next style)

Identify the **primary language** (source of truth) and **secondary languages**.

## Step 2: Key Parity Diff

For each namespace, compare keys between primary and secondary locales:

- Keys present in primary but missing from secondary -> **MISSING\_{LANG}**
- Keys present in secondary but missing from primary -> **EXTRA\_{LANG}**
- Report count per namespace and list all missing keys

## Step 3: Interpolation Consistency

For keys present in both languages, compare `{{variable}}` placeholders:

- Extract all `{{...}}` tokens from each value
- Flag mismatches where one language has a placeholder the other does not
- Report as **INTERPOLATION_MISMATCH** with key, primary placeholders, secondary placeholders

## Step 4: Plural Form Check

For keys ending in `_one`, verify a matching `_other` exists (and vice versa):

- Check all locale files
- Report missing plural counterparts as **PLURAL_GAP**

## Step 5: Hardcoded String Scan

Scan recently modified `.tsx` / `.jsx` / `.vue` files for user-facing text not wrapped in `t()`:

- Check for string literals in JSX (between `>` and `<`)
- Ignore: HTML entities, empty strings, single characters, CSS classes, test IDs
- Report as **HARDCODED** with file, line, and the string found

## Output Format

```
=== i18n Parity Report ===

NAMESPACE: common
  MISSING_EN: 2 keys (common.greeting, common.farewell)
  MISSING_NB: 0 keys
  INTERPOLATION_MISMATCH: 1 (common.welcome: nb has {{name}}, en missing)

NAMESPACE: products
  OK -- all keys match

PLURAL_GAPS: 1
  - nb/common.json: item_one exists but item_other missing

HARDCODED: 3
  - src/pages/Dashboard.tsx:42 -- "Velkommen tilbake"

SUMMARY: 3 MISSING_EN | 0 MISSING_NB | 1 MISMATCH | 1 PLURAL_GAP | 3 HARDCODED
```

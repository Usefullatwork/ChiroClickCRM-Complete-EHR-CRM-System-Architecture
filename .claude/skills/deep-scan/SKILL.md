# Deep Scan Pipeline

Configurable multi-pass content audit. Each pass can be enabled or disabled depending on the project.
Designed for websites, documentation, medical content, and multilingual sites — complements the
`overnight-sweep` skill (which focuses on code quality, not content quality).

---

## Configuration

Create `deep-scan-config.json` in project root to customize passes:

```json
{
  "passes": [
    "regulatory",
    "ai-language",
    "encoding",
    "sources",
    "parity",
    "cannibalization",
    "schema",
    "accessibility"
  ],
  "suppressions": {
    "regulatory": ["redirect-stubs", "code-blocks"],
    "cannibalization": ["redirect-stubs"]
  },
  "domain": "medical",
  "languages": ["nb", "en"],
  "severity_threshold": "MEDIUM"
}
```

If no config exists, all passes run with default settings.

## Pass 1: Regulatory Compliance

Scan content for forbidden words and missing required disclaimers. Severity: **CRITICAL** for violations that could cause legal issues.

### What to Check

- **Forbidden superlatives**: best, leading, guaranteed, cures, fixes, eliminates (medical/health context)
- **Unqualified medical claims**: Claims without hedging ("reduces pain" vs "may help reduce pain")
- **Missing disclaimers**: Health content without "consult a healthcare professional" or equivalent
- **Testimonial violations**: Fake reviews, AggregateRating without real data, fabricated patient quotes
- **Fear-based marketing**: Urgency language designed to bypass informed consent

### Known False Positive Patterns (filter these)

1. **Redirect stubs**: Files < 2KB with `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` — skip entirely
2. **Code blocks**: Forbidden words inside `<code>`, `<pre>`, or fenced markdown — skip
3. **Cited sentences**: Sentences ending with `<sup>N</sup>` citation — sourced claims are not violations
4. **Quoted material**: Content inside `<blockquote>` from external sources — flag as INFO not CRITICAL
5. **Comparative language**: "better than average" in research context with citation — not a superlative violation
6. **Negations**: "not guaranteed", "no cure" — opposite meaning, not a violation
7. **Legal/disclaimer sections**: Content inside disclaimer/footer elements — already qualified

### Domain-Specific Word Lists

- **Medical**: kurerer, fikser, garantert, best, ledende, helbreder, eliminerer, smertefri
- **Required hedging (Norwegian)**: kan lindre, kan bidra til, kan hjelpe, mulig, potensielt
- **Required hedging (English)**: may help, can contribute to, potentially, evidence suggests
- **Financial**: guaranteed returns, risk-free, cannot lose
- **General**: #1, world's best, industry-leading, unmatched

---

## Pass 2: AI Language Markers

Detect patterns suggesting AI-generated content that hasn't been humanized. Severity: **MEDIUM**.

### Marker Categories

- **Hedging phrases**: "It's important to note", "It's worth mentioning", "It should be noted"
- **Formulaic transitions**: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "In conclusion", "That being said"
- **Excessive qualifiers**: "Significantly", "Remarkably", "Interestingly", "Notably"
- **List introductions**: "Here are some key considerations", "Let's explore"
- **Filler summaries**: "In summary", "To summarize", "Overall"
- **Empathy theater**: "I understand your concern", "That's a great question"

### Scoring

Count markers per file. Thresholds:

- 0-2 markers per 1000 words: PASS
- 3-5 markers per 1000 words: MEDIUM (review recommended)
- 6+ markers per 1000 words: HIGH (likely needs rewriting)

---

## Pass 3: Encoding Integrity

Detect character corruption from encoding mismatches. Severity: **CRITICAL** for visible corruption.

### Corruption Sequences to Detect

| Corrupted | Original | Language          |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Ã¥        | å        | Norwegian/Swedish |
| Ã¸        | ø        | Norwegian         |
| Ã¦        | æ        | Norwegian         |
| Ã±        | ñ        | Spanish           |
| Ã¼        | ü        | German            |
| Ã¶        | ö        | Swedish/German    |
| â€™       | '        | Smart quote       |
| â€"       | —        | Em dash           |
| â€"       | –        | En dash           |

### Fix Pattern

If corruption found, use `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($true))` (UTF8 with BOM) on Windows. On Unix: `iconv` or ensure files are saved as UTF-8 without BOM.

---

## Pass 4: Source Citations

Count inline citations and reference lists. Flag files with factual claims but no sources. Severity: **CRITICAL** for unsourced medical/health claims.

### What to Count

- **Inline citations**: `(Author et al., Year)`, `(Author, Year)`, `<sup>N</sup>` patterns
- **Reference lists**: `<li>` elements inside `<section class="sources-section">` or `<ol>` in sources
- **Legacy format**: `<div><p>` reference sections (count these separately — scripts may miss them)

### Severity Levels

- 0 inline citations + 0 references + factual claims present: **CRITICAL**
- 0 inline citations + references exist (but not linked to claims): **MEDIUM**
- Inline citations present + reference list: **PASS**
- No factual claims (e.g., navigation pages, contact pages): **N/A** — skip

### Known False Positives

- Redirect stubs (< 2KB with `<meta refresh>`) — always skip
- PWA offline pages — skip
- Index/listing pages with no factual claims — skip

---

## Pass 5: Content Parity

Compare paired files across languages. Severity: **HIGH** for structural mismatches.

### What to Compare

- **Word count ratio**: Flag if outside 0.8-1.3 range (translation should be similar length)
- **Section count**: Both versions should have the same number of `<h2>`/`<h3>` sections
- **Image count**: Same number of images (alt text may differ)
- **Schema parity**: Both versions should have the same structured data types
- **FAQ parity**: Same number of FAQ items
- **Missing pairs**: Files that exist in one language but not the other

### Pairing Strategy

Use hreflang tags to find pairs. If no hreflang, use directory structure mapping (e.g., `plager/korsrygg/` ↔ `en/conditions/lower-back-pain/`).

---

## Pass 6: Cannibalization Detection

Find pages targeting the same keywords. Severity: **HIGH** when 2+ pages compete for identical search intent.

### Detection Method

1. Extract `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` from each page
2. Extract `<h1>` text
3. Group pages by similar title/H1 keywords (>60% word overlap)
4. Flag groups where 2+ non-redirect pages target the same intent

### Known False Positives

- **Redirect stubs**: `<meta refresh>` pages that redirect to canonical — exclude from analysis
- **Language variants**: NO and EN versions of the same page — not cannibalization
- **Hub + sub-article**: A hub page mentioning a topic and a dedicated article — intentional hierarchy

---

## Pass 7: Schema Validation

Check JSON-LD structured data matches page content. Severity: **MEDIUM** for mismatches.

### Checks

- FAQPage schema: answers must match body text exactly (not paraphrased)
- MedicalWebPage schema: `about` field matches page topic
- Article schema: `datePublished` is not in the future, `author` is not empty
- BreadcrumbList: URLs in breadcrumb exist and are not 404
- AggregateRating: Only present if backed by real review data (NOT fabricated)

---

## Pass 8: Accessibility

Check content accessibility. Severity: **MEDIUM** for missing attributes.

### Checks

- Images without `alt` attribute
- Missing `lang` attribute on `<html>` element
- Missing `role="alert"` on emergency/red-flag content
- Links without descriptive text (no "click here")
- Missing skip-to-content link
- Color contrast issues (if tooling available)
- Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements

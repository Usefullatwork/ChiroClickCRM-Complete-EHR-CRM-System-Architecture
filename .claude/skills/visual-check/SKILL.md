# Visual Verification Skill

Take screenshots of web pages and analyze them visually using Claude's multimodal capabilities.

## Quick Screenshot

1. Open URL: 2. Wait for load: 3. Screenshot: 4. Read and analyze: Use the Read tool on

## Mobile Check

1. Set mobile viewport: 2. Screenshot: 3. Read and analyze the mobile screenshot

## Desktop Check

1. Set desktop viewport: 2. Screenshot: 3. Read and analyze

## Full Page Capture

1. Open URL: 2. Wait for load: 3. Full page screenshot: 4. Read and analyze

## Visual Analysis Checklist

When analyzing screenshots, check:

- Layout alignment and spacing
- Typography (size, weight, line-height)
- Colors (exact hex match against spec)
- Responsive behavior
- Image sizing and positioning
- CTA visibility and placement
- Accessibility contrast ratios
- No overlapping elements
- No horizontal scrollbar on mobile
- Text is readable (not truncated or overflowing)

## Comparison Workflow

To compare before/after changes:

1. Screenshot before: 2. Make changes
2. Reload: 4. Wait: 5. Screenshot after: 6. Read both screenshots and describe differences

## Common Viewport Sizes

| Device        | Width | Height |
| ------------- | ----- | ------ |
| iPhone SE     | 375   | 667    |
| iPhone 14 Pro | 393   | 852    |
| iPad          | 768   | 1024   |
| Laptop        | 1280  | 720    |
| Desktop       | 1920  | 1080   |

## Gotchas (Windows)

- Use forward slashes in paths: not - agent-browser daemon mode keeps browser open between commands
- Use flag for labeled screenshots
- flag captures entire page (slow for long pages)
- If agent-browser is unavailable, fall back to Playwright CLI:

Vertigo is a specific type where you experience that you or your surroundings are rotating - typically described as \"the room is spinning\".\n\n \n\n \n Which type of dizziness is most common?\n\n BPPV is the most common, accounting for 17-42% of all dizziness cases investigated. Vestibular migraine is second most common among those with recurring episodes.\n\n \n\n \n Can stress cause dizziness?\n\n Yes. PPPD (Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness) is a condition where chronic dizziness is maintained by anxiety and stress. It is a real physiological condition, not imaginary.\n\n \n\n \n How do I know if my dizziness is serious?\n\n Warning signs include difficulty speaking, facial weakness, double vision, severe headache, or difficulty swallowing along with dizziness. Call emergency services immediately if you experience these symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n Can the neck cause dizziness?\n\n Yes, cervicogenic dizziness from neck problems is real, though the diagnosis is controversial. The neck contains sensors that send position information to the brain, and dysfunction here can cause unsteadiness."}]}

With BPPV, nausea typically lasts seconds to minutes after head movement. With vestibular neuritis, nausea can persist for days. With migraine, it can last for hours.\n\n \n\n \n Can stress cause dizziness and nausea?\n\n Yes. Stress and anxiety can cause hyperventilation which causes dizziness. Additionally, 30-50% of dizziness patients are also affected by anxiety or depression - this is a biological connection, not \"imagined.\"\n\n \n\n \n Is dizziness and nausea dangerous?\n\n Usually not. Most causes are benign and treatable. But acute dizziness with neurological symptoms (paralysis, speech difficulties, visual disturbances) can be signs of stroke and requires immediate medical evaluation.\n\n \n\n \n What helps against nausea?\n\n Treat the cause of dizziness. With BPPV, repositioning maneuver gives rapid improvement. During attacks, it can help to lie still, focus on a fixed point, and take deep breaths. Anti-nausea medications can be used short-term but should not be used for more than 2-3 days as they can delay healing."}]}

Many experience only general unsteadiness rather than the classic \"carousel feeling.\" Therefore, the condition is often overlooked.\n\n \n\n \n Medication Side Effects\n\n Many elderly take 5-10 different medications daily. The side effects - or combination of them - are a frequent cause of dizziness. The worst offenders include:\n\n \n Blood pressure medications (can cause too low pressure when standing)\n\n Sleep medications and sedatives\n\n Antidepressants\n\n Diuretics\n\n \n \n\n \n Multisensory Deficits\n\n Balance depends on three systems: vision, balance organ, and sensation in the feet.

The trigeminocervical complex (TCC) is an area in the brainstem where the trigeminal nerve (which controls sensation in the face and jaw) meets the upper cervical nerves from C1-C3.\n\n What's special is that nerve cells in this area receive signals from both the jaw and neck simultaneously. The brain therefore can't always distinguish where the pain actually comes from. Jaw pain can be felt as neck pain, and vice versa.\n\n Research from 2022 showed that stimulation of the C2 nerve inhibited signals from the trigeminal nerve in 53% of the nerve cells tested - direct evidence of this crossover."}]}

The same cervical vertebrae that participate in the trigeminocervical complex send proprioceptive signals (position sense) directly to the balance nuclei in the brainstem.\n\n The suboccipital muscles (the small muscles at the top of the neck) have the highest concentration of position sense cells in the entire body - 242 muscle spindles per gram compared to only 2.2 per gram in the trapezius.\n\n When these muscles are tense or dysfunctional, signals to the brain can become disturbed. The result is a sensory mismatch - the brain receives conflicting information from eyes, ears, and neck, and this is experienced as dizziness."}]}

Relaxin levels are highest in the first trimester, but the hormone remains in the body throughout pregnancy and for several months after delivery.\n\n \n\n \n Postural changes and center of gravity shift\n\n As the belly grows, the body's center of gravity shifts forward. To compensate, many pregnant women lean backward, leading to increased curvature in the lower back. This postural change propagates up the spine and affects the neck.\n\n \n\n \n Weight gain and breast enlargement\n\n The natural weight gain during pregnancy - typically 10-16 kilograms - puts extra strain on all weight-bearing joints. Breasts can increase significantly in size, pulling shoulders forward and creating tension in the upper back and neck.\n\n \n\n \n Sleep disturbances\n\n Good sleep becomes more difficult as pregnancy progresses. Many pregnant women struggle to find a comfortable sleeping position, need to get up multiple times during the night, and generally have restless sleep.

The terms \"lumbago\", \"disc herniation\" and \"sciatica\" appear interchangeably - often used as if they mean the same thing. They don't.\n \n\n \n The problem is that symptoms can overlap, and many believe they have a serious injury when the pain is actually caused by something far less dramatic. Around 85-95% of all back pain is non-specific, meaning without a detectable structural cause (WHO, 2023). True disc herniation with nerve involvement accounts for less than 5% of cases (StatPearls, 2024)."}]}

The medical term is acute lumbago or non-specific low back pain. The pain comes suddenly, often after an awkward movement, lift or twist - but can also occur seemingly without reason.\n \n\n \n Characteristics of lumbago:\n\n \n Localized pain in the lower back\n\n Pain may radiate diffusely to the buttocks or thighs, but never below the knee\n\n Stiff back with limited mobility\n\n Worst in the first few days, then gradual improvement\n\n No tingling, numbness or muscle weakness\n\n \n \n\n \n With lumbago, no specific structural cause is found. MRI or X-ray often shows \"normal\" age-related changes that don't explain the pain. This is actually good news: it means your body isn't damaged.\n \n\n \n Most people improve significantly within 6 weeks. Pain scores typically fall from around 56/100 to 26/100 during this period (Pengel et al., BMJ 2003). However, we must be honest: 33-73% experience recurrence within one year, and some develop chronic symptoms."}]}

Think of the disc as a jelly donut - with disc herniation, the \"jelly\" is pushed out.\n \n\n \n Important to know about disc herniation:\n\n \n Disc herniation is rarer than people think. Less than 5% of back pain is caused by symptomatic disc herniation. The vast majority of herniations occur at the two lowest levels: L4-L5 and L5-S1, which together account for 95% of cases.\n \n\n \n\n \n Here's the real surprise: You can have a disc herniation without knowing it. A large review of MRI studies (Brinjikji et al., AJNR 2015) showed that many healthy, pain-free people have disc herniations on MRI:\n \n\n \n \n \n Age\n Disc bulge\n Protrusion\n Degeneration\n \n \n \n \n 20 years\n 30%\n 29%\n 37%\n \n \n 40 years\n 50%\n 33%\n 68%\n \n \n 60 years\n 69%\n 38%\n 88%\n \n \n \n\n \n The good news: 66-77% of disc herniations resolve on their own (Zhong et al., 2017). In fact, research shows that the most dramatic herniations - where the disc has completely detached (sequestration) - have the highest resorption rate at 88% (Zou et al., 2023)."}]}

Rest Position for the Jaw\n\n Teach your jaw a new default setting:\n\n \n \"N technique\": Say the letter \"N\" and hold the jaw in that position\n\n Mantra: \"Lips together, teeth apart\"\n\n Tongue: Rest against the palate, just behind the front teeth\n\n \n \n\n \n 3. Breathing Techniques\n\n Breathing and jaw are closely connected:\n\n \n 4-7-8 breathing: In for 4, hold for 7, out for 8\n\n Diaphragmatic breathing: Breathe deeply into the belly\n\n Breathe through the nose: Calmer than mouth breathing\n\n \n \n\n \n 4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n\n \n Press teeth hard together for 5 seconds\n\n Release completely and feel the contrast\n\n Let the jaw hang heavy for 10 seconds\n\n Repeat 3-5 times\n\n \n By tensing first, you learn to feel the difference between tense and relaxed.\n\n \n\n \n 5.

Examination in room lighting misses about 60% of eye movements. Repeated testing with infrared camera or VNG may be necessary.\n\n \n\n \n Can treatment help even if the doctor found nothing?\n\n Yes. Studies show that 67-87% of patients with \"subjective BPPV\" (symptoms without visible eye movements) improve from repositioning maneuver.\n\n \n\n \n Why am I so tired when I'm \"only\" a little dizzy?\n\n The brain uses enormous energy compensating for confusing balance signals. 85% of chronic BPPV patients report fatigue, and 75% are on sick leave."}]}

The Gut-Brain Axis\n\n The so-called \"gut-brain axis\" explains communication between gut and brain:\n\n \n The gut has its own nervous system (the enteric nervous system)\n\n Gut flora affects mood and pain perception\n\n The brain can affect gut movements and sensitivity\n\n The same mechanisms can affect jaw function\n\n \n \n\n \n Serotonin Connection\n\n 95% of the body's serotonin is found in the gut. Serotonin affects gut function, mood, AND pain modulation. Imbalance in the serotonin system can contribute to both IBS and TMD.\n\n \n\n \n 4. Shared Psychological Factors\n\n Both conditions are associated with:\n\n \n Anxiety\n\n Depression\n\n Catastrophizing\n\n Sleep problems\n\n Feeling of lack of control"}]}

Horizontal canal BPPV accounts for 5-30% and is often triggered by turning the head from side to side while lying down. Treatment is different.\n\n \n\n \n How long does an episode last?\n\n A typical episode lasts 10-60 seconds. If the dizziness lasts for minutes, hours, or days, other causes should be considered.\n\n \n\n \n Can BPPV be dangerous?\n\n BPPV is a benign condition that is not dangerous in itself. However, the intense dizziness can lead to falls, especially in the elderly.\n\n \n\n \n Can vitamin D prevent BPPV?\n\n Research shows that vitamin D supplementation combined with calcium can reduce the recurrence rate in patients with proven vitamin D deficiency (Jeong et al., 2020)."}]}

The neck contains a high density of proprioceptive sensors. When these send inaccurate signals, a \"sensory mismatch\" can occur that is experienced as dizziness. The Barany Society (2022) acknowledges that this can probably occur in a subset of patients.\n\n \n\n \n How do I distinguish cervicogenic dizziness from BPPV?\n\n BPPV causes short (10-60 sec), intense spinning attacks. Cervicogenic dizziness causes a more persistent unsteadiness that worsens with neck movements and is often accompanied by neck pain.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI of my neck?\n\n Usually not. MRI is primarily relevant for red flags or lack of treatment response after 8-12 weeks. Degenerative findings are very common even in symptom-free people.\n\n \n\n \n How long until I get better?\n\n Most notice improvement within 4-6 weeks. Acute cases can respond faster (2-4 treatments), chronic cases may require 8-12 weeks."}]}

Prevalence varies between studies, but estimates are 50-200 per 100,000 adults. The disease most often affects people between 40 and 60 years old, with a peak in the 40s and 50s. Women are somewhat more commonly affected than men, with a ratio of approximately 1.5-1.9:1. Less than 3% of cases occur in people under 18 years old.\n\n \n \n 50-200\n per 100,000 adults\n \n\n \n 40-60 yrs\n most common age group\n \n\n \n 7-10%\n have family history"}]}

The inner ear consists of a labyrinth system filled with fluid that must have the right pressure and chemical composition to function normally.\n\n In Meniere's disease, too much fluid is produced, or drainage does not work properly. This causes the pressure to rise. At high pressure, a thin membrane (Reissner's membrane) can rupture, and fluids with different chemical compositions mix. This disrupts the signals to the brain and triggers the characteristic attack.\n\n \n Genetic Component\n\n Approximately 7-10% of patients with Meniere's disease have a family history of the condition."}]}

After an actual break-in (an acute dizziness episode), you adjust the sensitivity to maximum. Suddenly the alarm goes off every time the wind blows. This is how PPPD works.\n\n After an acute event - such as crystal disease, vestibular neuritis, concussion or a period of intense stress - the brain enters \"crisis mode.\" In PPPD, the brain forgets to turn off this crisis mode.\n\n Three Things Happen:\n\n \n Visual Dependence\n\n The brain no longer trusts the balance system in the ear, so it clings to vision. That's why you become dizzy in the supermarket or when scrolling on your phone. This is also common in vestibular migraine.\n\n \n\n \n Body Stiffness\n\n You unconsciously tense muscles in your neck and legs to \"hold on.\" This causes secondary neck pain and a stiff gait, similar to what is seen in cervicogenic dizziness.\n\n \n\n \n Anxiety Loop\n\n Every time you feel unsteady, the brain thinks \"Danger!\" and turns up the alarm even more.\n\n \n\n \n What Happens in the Brain with PPPD?\n\n Neuroimaging studies have shown that this is not \"imagination\" - there are measurable changes in brain function. Reduced activity in the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), and increased activity in visual areas. The good news is that the brain is plastic - with proper treatment, these patterns can be reversed."}]}

This is the most common form and is most often caused by vestibular neuritis (virus on the balance nerve).\n\n How does it work? The balance organs in the right and left ear normally function as a \"push-pull\" system. When you turn your head to the right, the signal from the right ear increases while it decreases from the left. With one-sided damage, an imbalance occurs that the brain interprets as constant rotation. The good news is that the brain is remarkably good at compensating for one-sided damage.\n\n \n\n \n Bilateral Vestibular Hypofunction (Two-sided)\n\n In bilateral hypofunction, the balance organs function poorly or not at all on both sides. This is a rarer and more serious condition.\n\n How does it work? When both sides are \"silent,\" the brain receives no information about the head's movements. It's like driving a car without a speedometer and without windows - you have no idea how you're moving.\n\n Prevalence: Approximately 28 per 100,000 adults.

The suboccipital muscles have extremely high muscle spindle density - 242 spindles per gram compared to only 2.2 per gram in the trapezius. When these are damaged, the neck sends error signals to the brain.\n\n \n Sensory Mismatch\n\n The eyes say \"you're standing still\", the ear says \"you're standing still\", but the neck says \"the head is moving!\".

Tennis elbow causes pain on the OUTSIDE and affects the extensor muscles\n (that extend the wrist). The treatment principles are similar.\n\n \n\n \n Can I have both golfer's and tennis elbow at the same time?\n\n Yes, this is not uncommon, especially with office work. Both flexors and extensors\n can become overloaded simultaneously. Treatment must then address both sides.\n\n \n\n \n Why are my fingers tingling?\n\n Tingling in the little finger and ring finger indicates that the ulnar nerve is\n involved. This occurs in 20-60% of patients with golfer's elbow. The nerve passes right by the tender\n area and can become irritated.\n\n \n\n \n Should I use an elbow brace?\n\n A golfer's elbow brace can provide symptomatic relief. It should be placed about\n 2-3 cm below the elbow on the inside. Use it as a supplement to training, not as the a key treatment approach.\n \n\n \n\n \n Can I continue to exercise?\n\n Yes, but avoid exercises that provoke pain. Bicep curls and pulling exercises can\n be problematic. Focus on rehabilitation exercises and temporarily modify strength training.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need surgery?\n\n Rarely. 85-96% recover without surgery. Surgery is only considered for prolonged\n problems (over 12 months) without effect from thorough conservative treatment."}]}

That's why\n the term \"tendinosis\" has replaced \"tendinitis\" in professional circles (Coombes et al., 2015).\n\n Who is affected?\n\n Despite the name, ironically only 5-10% of cases are caused by tennis. Most cases arise from:\n\n \n Repetitive work with mouse and keyboard (mouse arm)\n\n Manual labor (carpentry, painting, plumbing)\n\n Housework and gardening\n\n Other sports (strength training, golf, badminton)\n\n \n\n \n \n 1-3%\n of the population affected\n \n\n \n 35-54 years\n most common age group\n \n\n \n 90%\n dominant arm"}]}

The condition is sometimes confused with De Quervain's\n tenosynovitis or trigger finger, which also cause thumb problems.\n \n\n The joint has a \"saddle shape\" that allows movement in multiple planes.

They occur in\n 85-95% of patients with chronic pain.\n\n \n\n \n Can trigger points be confused with tennis elbow?\n\n Yes, trigger points in the forearm muscles can cause pain resembling tennis elbow.\n Studies show that 70% of patients with tennis elbow have active trigger points contributing to their\n pain. Both conditions can also occur simultaneously.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to get rid of trigger points?\n\n Fresh trigger points can resolve after 1-3 treatments. Chronic trigger points that\n have been present for months or years often require 4-8 treatments over several weeks, combined with\n self-treatment.\n\n \n\n \n Is treatment painful?\n\n Treatment of trigger points involves pressure on tender points, so some discomfort\n is normal. The pain should be \"good pain\" - uncomfortable but tolerable. Afterward there may be some\n soreness for 1-2 days before improvement occurs.\n\n \n\n \n Can trigger points come back?\n\n Yes, if the causative factors aren't corrected. That's why it's important to\n identify what triggered the trigger points - repetitive movements, poor ergonomics, stress - and make\n changes to prevent recurrence."}]}

Silbernagel's pain monitoring model (2007) shows that\n continued activity is safe as long as pain stays below 5/10 during exercise and doesn't worsen the next\n day. You may need to adjust type, duration or intensity temporarily.\n\n \n\n \n Is there inflammation in my tendon?\n\n No, despite many calling it \"tendinitis\". Modern research shows that Achilles\n tendinopathy is primarily a degenerative process with changes in tendon structure, not classic\n inflammation. This is also why anti-inflammatory medications have limited effect.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI or ultrasound?\n\n Rarely. The diagnosis is made clinically, and imaging usually doesn't change the\n treatment plan. Important to know: 46% of symptom-free runners have tendon changes on ultrasound.\n Imaging is primarily done when rupture is suspected, for uncertain diagnoses, or for surgical\n evaluation.\n\n \n\n \n Do heel lifts or orthotic insoles help?\n\n The evidence is limited. Heel lifts can provide temporary pain relief by reducing\n the stretch on the tendon, but should be viewed as a supplement to - not a replacement for -\n exercise-based treatment.\n\n \n\n \n How long until I recover?\n\n It depends on duration and severity.

Mobilization, proper footwear, insoles and exercises can\n substantially reduce pain and improve function. The condition isn't \"cured,\" but symptoms can be well\n controlled.\n\n \n\n \n What is the difference between hallux rigidus and hallux valgus?\n\n Hallux rigidus is osteoarthritis with stiffness in the big toe's base joint - the\n toe usually remains straight but becomes stiff. Hallux valgus (bunion) is a malalignment where the big\n toe bends toward the other toes and causes a bump on the inside of the foot. Both can cause pain, but\n the causes and treatment are different.\n\n \n\n \n Which shoes are best for hallux rigidus?\n\n Choose shoes with a stiff sole (rocker-sole), roomy toe box and low heel. The\n shoes shouldn't bend much at the big toe. Avoid high heels and flexible soles that force the joint to\n bend. Special insoles (Morton's extension) can be helpful.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take for hallux rigidus to get worse?\n\n Progression varies greatly from person to person. Some remain stable for many\n years, while others experience gradual worsening over months to years.

Toe spreaders, proper footwear and strengthening\n exercises provide 80-90% good relief. Surgery is only necessary for significant pain and functional\n impairment.\n\n \n\n \n Is hallux valgus hereditary?\n\n Yes, genetics plays a significant role. Studies show 63-90% heritability. If\n parents have hallux valgus, the risk is significantly higher. But genetic predisposition + wrong\n footwear over time is the typical pattern - genetics predisposes, but environmental factors trigger.\n \n\n \n\n \n Do toe spreaders help with hallux valgus?\n\n Toe spreaders can provide pain relief and better toe separation during use, but do\n not permanently change the underlying deformity. They are most useful combined with strengthening\n exercises and proper footwear. Use them gradually - start with short periods and increase over time.\n \n\n \n\n \n When should I consider surgery for hallux valgus?\n\n Surgery is considered only after 6-12 months of failed conservative treatment, and\n only for persistent pain affecting daily activities, significant functional impairment, progressive\n worsening, or secondary problems such as hammer toe. 85-90% achieve good relief after surgery.\n\n \n\n \n Can I continue to exercise with hallux valgus?\n\n Yes, exercise is often beneficial.

With early intervention (footwear change, adapted pads), however, many can achieve symptom\n control without further treatment.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take for treatment to work?\n\n With manual treatment, many see improvement within 4-6 treatments. 79% achieved\n complete pain relief within 6 treatments. Footwear changes and orthotics often need 4-6 weeks for full\n effect.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI or ultrasound?\n\n Not necessarily. Clinical examination with thumb-index finger squeeze test has 96%\n sensitivity and can often confirm the diagnosis. Imaging is most relevant for uncertain diagnoses,\n injection planning, or possible surgery.\n\n \n\n \n Can I continue to exercise?\n\n Activities that don't provoke pain can often be continued. Running and activities\n with high forefoot loading may need to be modified temporarily. Shoes with wide toe box are especially\n important during exercise.\n\n \n\n \n Does cortisone help?\n\n Ultrasound-guided cortisone injection can provide short-term relief (1-3 months),\n but long-term effectiveness is limited. About 30% eventually need surgery despite injections.\n\n \n\n \n What about surgery?\n\n Surgery is considered after 6-12 months without sufficient effect from\n conservative treatment. The success rate is high (74% complete pain relief), but involves expected\n numbness in the supplied toes."}]}

The short foot exercise is particularly well documented and recommended as a first choice.\n\n \n\n \n Can I train my feet while using orthotics?\n\n Yes, absolutely. Foot training can be done alongside orthotic use. Many choose to gradually reduce orthotic use as foot strength increases. Consult a professional about an individual plan for tapering. Read more about orthotic tapering here.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to see results?\n\n Most notice better control and less fatigue after 2-4 weeks. Measurable strength gains are typically seen after 4-8 weeks. Full structural adaptation and maximum strength gains take 3-6 months of consistent training.\n\n \n\n \n Can foot training replace orthotics?\n\n For many, yes. Research shows that foot training is more effective than orthotics for most non-specific foot problems. Exceptions include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and severe structural deformities where orthotics have clear indications.\n\n \n\n \n Is it too late to start foot training?\n\n No. Studies show that even elderly people who have never trained their feet can achieve significant improvements in strength and balance.

The Arch Must Stabilize Itself\n\n Without artificial support from shoes or orthotics, the foot's own muscles must activate to maintain the arch with each step.\n\n \n\n \n 2. Natural Shock Absorption\n\n Without thick cushioning, the body learns to land softly on the forefoot/midfoot, which activates foot muscles as natural shock absorbers.\n\n \n\n \n 3. Adaptation to Terrain\n\n A flexible sole allows the foot to adapt to irregularities, stimulating small muscles and proprioceptors.\n\n \n\n \n 4. Toes Get to Work\n\n Wide toe box allows toes to spread and grip, activating toe muscles that otherwise remain passive in narrow shoes.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n Comparison: Shoes vs. Cast\n\n Modern shoes with stiff soles, narrow toe boxes, and high drop do much of the same as a cast: they immobilize structures and allow muscles to atrophy. Minimalist shoes do the opposite - they allow the foot to move freely and build strength."}]}

People over 50, those with diabetes, previous stress fractures, or significant overweight should be extra careful and possibly seek guidance from a professional.\n\n \n\n \n Can children use minimalist shoes?\n\n Yes, children are actually ideal candidates for minimalist shoes. Children's feet are naturally strong and adaptable. The earlier they get to walk in flexible shoes with a wide toe box, the better for natural foot development. Several studies (Hollander 2017) show that children who walk barefoot have better motor skills and balance.\n\n \n\n \n Do I have to run barefoot to get the benefits?\n\n No. Daily use of minimalist shoes provides significant strength gains without running barefoot. The Liverpool study showed 57% strength increase just from walking in minimalist shoes daily. Barefoot running is optional and requires extra caution.\n\n \n\n \n What about winter conditions?\n\n Several minimalist shoe brands offer winter variants with insulation and waterproof membrane. Vivobarefoot, Xero Shoes and Lems all have winter models. Alternatively, you can use minimalist shoes indoors and more traditional winter shoes outdoors in the cold - even partial use provides benefits.\n\n \n\n \n How long does the transition take?\n\n For daily use: 2-3 months for most people.

The most important thing is to listen to your body and not rush the process.\n\n \n\n \n Can I exercise during the weaning process?\n\n Yes, but consider using your orthotics during intensive training at first. As your feet get stronger, you can also train without them. Start with low-intensity activities first.\n\n \n\n \n What if the pain returns?\n\n Go back one step in the protocol and stay there until the pain has been gone for at least a week. Increase focus on foot exercises. If the pain persists, seek professional evaluation.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need special shoes during the weaning process?\n\n Start with regular, comfortable shoes with moderate support. Avoid both very rigid shoes and minimalist shoes at the beginning. Over time, you can gradually transition to shoes with less support.\n\n \n\n \n What if I've used orthotics for many years?\n\n The longer you've used orthotics, the longer your feet need to adapt. Consider doubling the time intervals in the protocol, and be extra patient with progression.\n\n \n\n \n Can children wean off orthotics?\n\n Children often have great adaptability.

The foot is designed to pronate upon landing - it is the body's built-in shock absorption. The problem arises when normal variation is pathologized as overpronation. There is no scientifically defined limit for what is too much pronation.\n\n \n\n \n Do children with flat feet need orthotics?\n\n No, in the vast majority of cases. Research concludes that there is no evidence base for orthotics in children with flat feet. Flexible flat feet in children is a normal variant that usually develops normally. Unnecessary treatment can actually hinder natural foot development.\n\n \n\n \n Why do practitioners still prescribe for overpronation?\n\n Several factors are at play: tradition from education, economic incentives (the orthotics market is worth billions), visual logic (it looks wrong), and lack of updated knowledge on newer research. Many practitioners are genuinely convinced because they learned this as established science.\n\n \n\n \n Should I stop using my motion control shoes?\n\n If they are comfortable and you have no problems, there is no reason to switch immediately. But if you are considering new shoes, research suggests that comfort is a better guide than pronation measurement. A gradual transition to more neutral shoes may be appropriate for many.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor help with foot problems?\n\n Yes.

Support makes feet even weaker. Weaker feet need even more support.

Low-impact activities like cycling and swimming are\n often well tolerated. When running or walking: reduce distance and intensity, increase gradually, and\n listen to your body. Pain that worsens during or after activity is a signal to reduce the load.\n\n \n\n \n Do heel spur insoles help?\n\n Insoles can help somewhat in the short term. A meta-analysis from 2017 found\n moderate effect at 6-12 weeks. Interestingly, one study showed that ready-made prefabricated insoles\n combined with stretching were actually more effective than custom-made insoles plus stretching.\n\n \n\n \n Should I have the heel spur surgically removed?\n\n No. The heel spur is not the cause of the pain, and removing the spur alone does\n not improve the outcome. Surgery is only considered in the 5-10% of cases where conservative treatment\n over 6-12 months has not helped, and then usually involves partial release of the plantar fascia - not\n removal of the spur.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to recover?\n\n Most experience significant improvement within 3-6 months with proper treatment.\n For some, it takes up to 12 months. Early treatment is associated with faster improvement. Remember that\n recurrence is common (30-50%), so maintenance exercises are important even after recovery.\n\n \n\n \n What about cortisone injections?\n\n Cortisone injections can provide short-term relief (up to 1 month), but have\n limited long-term e..."}]}

Full\n return to sport usually takes 8-16 weeks depending on location and severity.\n\n \n\n \n Can I walk with a stress fracture?\n\n For low-risk fractures (e.g., 2nd-3rd metatarsal), you can often walk with\n supportive footwear or a walker boot. For high-risk fractures (5th metatarsal, navicular), complete\n offloading with crutches may be necessary. Always follow your doctor's or chiropractor's\n recommendations.\n\n \n\n \n Does a stress fracture show on X-ray?\n\n Often not in the first 2-3 weeks. Early stress fractures and stress reactions are\n best seen on MRI, which is the gold standard. X-rays may show the fracture after 2-6 weeks when callus\n (new bone tissue) forms. If stress fracture is clinically suspected, MRI should be requested.\n\n \n\n \n How do I prevent stress fractures?\n\n Follow the 10% rule (don't increase training volume more than 10% per week),\n ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D, wear good shoes that are replaced regularly, vary surfaces, and\n listen to your body. For women, regular menstruation is important for bone health.\n\n \n\n \n Can I exercise with a stress fracture?\n\n You can train upper body and do non-weight-bearing activities like swimming, pool\n running and cycling (if pain-free).

Conservative treatment with strength\n training, orthotic insoles and activity modification gives good results for about 90% of patients in\n early stages. Early treatment is crucial to prevent progression to more serious stages.\n\n \n\n \n What is the difference between tibialis posterior tendinopathy and flat foot?\n \n\n Tibialis posterior tendinopathy is an injury to the tendon that supports the foot\n arch. When the tendon weakens, the foot arch can gradually collapse leading to acquired flat foot. Flat\n foot can also be congenital. PTTD is the most common cause of acquired flat foot in adults.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to recover from tibialis posterior tendinopathy?\n\n Recovery varies depending on stage. Stage 1 can improve in 2-3 months with proper\n treatment. Stage 2 can take 6-12 months and often requires continuous use of insoles. Ongoing strength\n training is important to prevent recurrence.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need special insoles for tibialis posterior tendinopathy?\n\n Insoles that support the foot arch are often an important part of treatment. In\n early stages, prefabricated insoles may be sufficient. With more advanced disease, custom orthotics or\n support braces (AFO) may be necessary.

Here are evidence-based exercises for common conditions:\n\n \n 1. Calf Stretching (Plantar Fasciopathy)\n\n Stand with your forefoot on a step, letting the heel hang over the edge. Lower slowly until you feel a stretch in the calf and Achilles. Hold 30-60 seconds. Repeat 3 times on each side. Do twice daily.\n\n \n\n \n 2. Eccentric Heel Raises (Achilles Tendinopathy)\n\n Stand on tiptoes with both feet. Lift one foot and lower slowly on the affected side until the heel is below the step. Use the healthy leg to push up again. 3 sets of 15 repetitions, twice daily for 12 weeks.\n\n \n\n \n 3. Balance Training (Ankle Instability)\n\n Stand on one leg with eyes open. Progress to: eyes closed, unstable surface, catching/throwing a ball. 3 sets of 30 seconds on each leg, daily. Reduces re-injury risk by 35%.\n\n \n\n \n 4. Towel Scrunches (General Foot Strength)\n\n Sit with a towel under your foot. Use your toes to scrunch the towel towards you. Repeat 10-15 times, 2-3 sets. Strengthens the intrinsic muscles of the foot.\n\n \n\n \n The Key: Optimal Loading\n\n The goal is \"optimal loading\": enough load to stimulate healing, but not so much that you worsen the injury. Complete rest is rarely the solution. I provide specific advice tailored to your situation."}]}

Although migraine is often associated with pain in the temple or forehead, the pain starts in the back of the head in about 18% of patients.\n\n Typical signs: Unilateral, pulsating pain, nausea, light and sound sensitivity, worsening with physical activity.\n\n \n\n \n \n Cervicogenic Headache (from the neck)\n\n 2.5-4% of population\n \n\n Cervicogenic headache has a special place in Norwegian medical history.

Passes through the neck muscles and supplies the largest part of the back of the head. Most commonly involved in occipital neuralgia.\n\n Lesser occipital nerve: Comes from C2-C3. Supplies the area behind the ear and lateral part of the back of the head.\n\n Third occipital nerve: Comes from C3. Supplies the lower part of the back of the head.\n\n \n \n\n \n Prevalence\n\n Occipital neuralgia is relatively rare as an isolated diagnosis - exact prevalence is unknown, but it's considered one of the less common headaches.

In many cases, no clear cause is found.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor help with occipital neuralgia?\n\n Manual treatment can be helpful for occipital neuralgia, especially when the condition is caused by muscle tension or dysfunction in the upper neck. Treatment aims to reduce muscle tension and improve neck mobility.\n\n \n\n \n How does occipital neuralgia differ from other headaches?\n\n Occipital neuralgia typically causes unilateral, stabbing/burning pain from the neck/back of head junction that radiates upward toward the crown. The pain often comes in attacks, and the scalp may be tender to touch. Migraine and tension headache have different characteristics.\n\n \n\n \n Is occipital neuralgia dangerous?\n\n Occipital neuralgia is not dangerous in itself, but the pain can be very bothersome and affect quality of life. It's important to get the correct diagnosis to rule out other causes of the symptoms."}]}

If you have recurring episodes of \"sinus headache\" without fever and purulent secretion, it's far more likely you have migraine with autonomic symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n Why don't antibiotics help my headache?\n\n Because the headache probably isn't caused by a bacterial infection. Repeated courses of antibiotics for \"sinusitis\" that don't provide lasting relief is a strong signal that the diagnosis should be reconsidered.\n\n \n\n \n Can CT or X-ray show if it's the sinuses?\n\n Imaging can show swelling in the sinuses, but this is common even with migraine and colds. Findings on CT don't automatically mean the sinuses are causing the headache.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need to see a neurologist to get a migraine diagnosis?\n\n No, the diagnosis is usually made by a GP based on medical history and clinical examination. Referral to a neurologist is relevant for uncertain diagnosis, poor treatment response, or alarm symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor treat migraine?\n\n Chiropractors can assess whether the neck contributes to the headache picture and treat any findings.

Tension headache most often develops through an interplay of several factors:\n\n \n 1. Muscular Tension and Trigger Points\n\n Tender knots (trigger points) in neck and jaw muscles are the most consistent finding. A meta-analysis from 2022 (Pain Physician) found that chronic patients had significantly increased tenderness in pericranial muscles (SMD 1.57).\n\n In people with chronic tension headache, research has found an average of 3.9 trigger points per patient, compared to 1.4 in healthy controls (Couppe et al., 2007).\n\n \n\n \n 2. Stress and Mental Strain\n\n Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and automatically increases muscle tension. One study found that headache frequency increased by 4.3% for every 10-point increase on the stress scale. Many recognize that shoulders rise and jaw clenches during demanding periods.\n\n \n\n \n 3. Sleep Disturbances\n\n About 50% of patients with tension headache have sleep problems (Odegard et al., 2010). Poor sleep quality lowers the pain threshold and is an independent risk factor for chronification. Many therefore experience morning headache as a result of poor night sleep.\n\n \n\n \n 4. Central Sensitization\n\n With prolonged tension headache, changes occur in the central nervous system.

The vast majority (over 90%) have tendinopathy (tendon changes) in the gluteus medius\n or minimus. Therefore, the term GTPS (Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome) is now used instead of\n trochanteric bursitis.\n\n \n\n \n Does cortisone injection help with pain on the outside of the hip?\n\n Cortisone often provides short-term relief (4-8 weeks), but is no better than\n placebo in the long term. The LEAP study from 2018 showed that exercises gave 77% success after 52\n weeks, compared to only 58% for cortisone injection. Cortisone can actually weaken tendons over time.\n \n\n \n\n \n What exercises help with GTPS?\n\n Progressive strength training for the gluteal muscles (gluteus medius and minimus)\n is well-documented. Start with isometric exercises (static holds) and progress to concentric and\n eccentric exercises. Avoid stretching and external rotation in the beginning, as this can irritate the\n tendons.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to recover from GTPS?\n\n With proper treatment (exercises and load management), many see improvement within\n 6-12 weeks. Full recovery can take 3-6 months in chronic cases. The key is gradual progression of\n exercises and avoiding provocations like lying on your side and crossing your legs."}]}

Research shows that most of the pain is caused by tendon problems, not bursitis.\n Treatment is similar regardless.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to recover?\n\n GTPS often takes 6-9 months to treat effectively. The LEAP study showed that 79%\n were better after 1 year with proper exercise treatment. Getting worse before better is not unusual.\n \n\n \n\n \n Should I avoid lying on the painful side?\n\n Yes, in the acute phase. Side-lying compresses the tendons against the\n trochanter. Use a pillow between your knees or lie on the healthy side. Gradual acclimatization as\n pain subsides.\n\n \n\n \n Does stretching help?\n\n Be careful with stretching. Many stretching exercises compress the tendons and\n can make things worse. Focus on strength training instead.\n\n \n\n \n Can I continue to exercise?\n\n Yes, but you need to adjust your training. Avoid exercises that cause a lot of\n pain, especially in end-range positions. Activities like cycling and swimming are often well\n tolerated."}]}

Hurts\n to lie on that side at night. Gets worse with stairs, longer walks or getting up from a chair. Can\n radiate down the outside of the thigh toward the knee.\n\n \n Myth: \"It's bursitis\"\n\n No, it almost never is. Studies show that less than 5% actually have inflammation in the bursa. In\n 85-98%, the problem is in the tendons of the gluteal muscles - gluteus medius and minimus. This is\n called gluteal tendinopathy or GTPS, and requires completely different treatment\n than cortisone.\n\n \n\n Who is affected? GTPS occurs in 15% of women and 6-8% of men between 50-79 years.\n Women are affected over 3 times as often. The condition accounts for 10-20% of all hip pain at the GP.\n \n\n Prognosis: The LEAP study showed that exercise + education gave 78.6%\n success rate after one year - better than cortisone (58%) and \"wait and see\" (52%).\n Improvement takes time (6-9 months), but most get better without injections.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Pain in the GROIN (front of hip)\n\n Complex\n \n\n Typical signs: Deep pain at the front of the hip or groin. Worst when bending the\n hip far (putting on shoes, sitting for long periods, climbing stairs). May feel stiff in the morning.\n Some experience clicking or catching.\n\n Groin pain can have several causes - and age and activity level provide important clues:\n\n \n Hip osteoarthritis: Most common in those over 55-60 years. 10-15% of people over\n 65 have symptomatic hip osteoarthritis. Causes gradually increasing stiffness, especially with\n internal rotation. Exercise is the first choice.\n\n FAI (femoroacetabular impingement): Pinching in the hip joint due to bone shape.\n Common in young, active people. Causes pain with deep flexion + internal rotation. 37% of pain-free\n people have FAI morphology on MRI - so images must be interpreted carefully.\n\n Labral tear: Damage to the cartilage ring around the hip. Often causes clicking,\n catching or feeling that the hip \"pops out.\" 69% of pain-free adults have labral tears on\n MRI - so not every tear needs treatment.\n\n Iliopsoas tendinopathy: Pain when lifting the leg, often with \"snapping\" at the\n front of the hip. Common in runners, dancers and soccer players.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n Pain in the BUTTOCK or back\n\n Difficult to sort out\n \n\n Typical signs: Pain in the buttock, lower back or behind the hip. Can radiate down\n the thigh. Often worse when sitting, standing on one leg or turning in bed.\n\n Buttock pain can come from the hip, back OR pelvis. Here are some clues:\n\n \n SI joint (\"pelvic loosening\"): If you can point with one finger to where it hurts\n - right at the \"dimple\" at the top of the buttock - it's often the SI joint. SI joint problems\n account for 15-30% of all chronic low back pain.\n\n Piriformis syndrome: Deep buttock pain that can radiate down the back of the\n thigh. Mimics sciatica, but comes from a tight muscle - not the back.\n\n Sit bone (proximal hamstring): Painful to sit, especially on hard chairs? Pain\n where \"buttock meets thigh\"? This could be tendinopathy at the hamstring attachment.\n Important: don't stretch the hamstrings - it makes it worse.\n \n\n Referred pain from the back: Problems in the low back can cause pain that feels\n like it's in the buttock or hip. Studies show that 71% of patients with hip problems actually have\n buttock pain as their dominant symptom.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n Numbness, tingling or burning pain\n\n Nerve involvement\n \n\n Typical signs: Burning, tingling or numb feeling. Can be on the outside of the\n thigh, or radiate from back/buttock down the leg.\n\n \n Meralgia paresthetica: Compression of a nerve causing numbness or burning on the\n outside of the thigh. Common with overweight, pregnancy or tight pants/belts. 85% get better\n without surgery.\n\n Sciatica/lumbar radiculopathy: Radiation from back/buttock down the back or\n outside of the leg - often past the knee to the foot.

Stretching compresses the tendon against the sit\n bone and often makes things worse. Focus on strength training instead. Gentle dynamic mobility is fine,\n but avoid prolonged static stretching.\n\n \n\n \n Can I continue running?\n\n Often you need to significantly reduce volume initially. Flat running at low\n intensity is tolerated better than hills and intervals. Build up gradually as pain subsides. Running\n should not cause more than 3/10 pain.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to recover?\n\n PHT is often long-lasting. Expect 3-6 months of proper treatment for significant\n improvement. Some need up to 12 months. Early diagnosis and treatment give better prognosis. Patience is\n key.\n\n \n\n \n Does cortisone help?\n\n Cortisone injection can provide short-term pain relief, but is not first choice.\n Research shows it does not improve long-term outcomes and can weaken tendon tissue. Strength training is\n more effective for lasting improvement.\n\n \n\n \n How should I sit?\n\n Avoid hard chairs. Use a seat cushion that relieves the sit bone - either a\n wedge-shaped cushion or one with a cutout at the back. Get up and move regularly. Consider a standing\n desk for periods."}]}

It is one of the body's most\n stable joints with very strong ligaments. What happens is that the joint becomes irritated, stiff or\n develops altered movement - not that it moves. The term \"pelvic locking\" is colloquially used but is not\n medically correct.\n\n \n\n \n Why does manipulation help when the joint is not out of place?\n\n Manipulation affects the nervous system and muscles around the joint. It can\n reduce pain, decrease muscle tension and restore normal movement in a stiff joint. The effect is\n neurological and biomechanical - not that something is \"put back in place\".\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to recover?\n\n Most people with acute SI joint problems improve significantly within 4-8 weeks\n with proper treatment. Chronic cases may take longer. Maintenance exercises are important to prevent\n recurrence.\n\n \n\n \n Should I use an SI belt?\n\n An SI belt can provide temporary support in the acute phase, but should not be\n used for long periods. The goal is to build up the body's own stability through exercise, not to become\n dependent on external support.\n\n \n\n \n Can I exercise with SI joint pain?\n\n Yes, adapted exercise is important! Avoid exercises that provoke pain, but stay\n active. Swimming, walking and specific stabilization exercises are often well tolerated.

Exercise gives better results after 1 year. Read more about treatment.\n\n \n\n \n Can I exercise with hip pain?\n\n Yes, and you should! Research shows that exercise is more effective than passive treatment for most hip pain.

Combination with exercises and possibly manual therapy gives better results.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take for TMJ problems to resolve?\n\n This varies greatly. Acute cases may improve in days to weeks with proper treatment. Subacute problems (6-12 weeks) often require a more systematic approach. Chronic cases (>3 months) may take longer and often require focus on multiple factors, including stress management.\n\n \n\n \n Is jaw clicking dangerous?\n\n Clicking in the jaw joint is common and often harmless.

This view has been fundamentally challenged by modern research.\n\n \n What the research says\n\n \n Manfredini et al. (2017): \"Clinicians are encouraged to abandon the old gnathological paradigm in TMD practice.\"\n\n Cochrane review (2024): No evidence that occlusion treatment treats or prevents TMD.\n\n NIDCR (USA): \"For many years it was believed that malocclusion causes TMD; however, there is no evidence supporting this view.\"\n\n \n \n\n An interesting finding is reversed causality: Several studies show that bite deviations can be consequences of TMD, not causes. For example, open bite can develop from internal TMJ dysfunction.\n\n Norwegian guidelines from the Norwegian Directorate of Health (2016) are clear: \"So far, no clear connection has been found between dental occlusion and development of TMD symptoms.\"\n\n \n\n \n \n \n 4\n What about headache and bite?\n\n \n\n The connection between malocclusion and headache is also poorly documented. Van der Meer and colleagues concluded in Cephalalgia (2019) that primary headaches like tension headache and migraine \"are not caused by musculoskeletal dysfunction\" - even though they may be associated with such symptoms.\n\n The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) recognizes \"headache attributed to temporomandibular dysfunction\" as secondary headache. But this relates to TMD itself - not to bite deviation directly.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n 5\n Symptoms of TMJ disorders\n\n \n\n TMD can cause a wide range of symptoms:\n\n \n Pain in jaw, face, or in front of the ear\n\n Clicking or crunching when opening mouth/chewing\n\n Limited jaw opening or jaw locking\n\n Fatigue in the chewing muscles\n\n Headache, especially in the temples\n\n Ear pain or feeling of \"blocked\" ear (without infection)\n\n Neck pain and stiffness\n\n \n\n Symptoms vary from mild to significantly disabling. Many experience symptoms that come and go, often in connection with stressful periods.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n 6\n Diagnosis\n\n \n\n TMD is primarily diagnosed through clinical examination. The chiropractor will examine the jaw joint, chewing muscles, neck, and head movement. Jaw opening is measured, and we listen for sounds from the joint.\n\n Imaging (MRI/X-ray) is rarely necessary for typical TMD symptoms. Studies show that imaging findings often don't correlate with symptoms - many without problems have \"abnormal\" findings on MRI, and many with problems have normal images. Clinical examination is therefore more important than images in most cases.\n\n \n When is imaging relevant?\n\n Imaging may be relevant when structural changes are suspected, after trauma, or if conservative treatment doesn't work over time."}]}

No reason for concern or treatment.\n\n \n\n \n 2. Crepitation (Grinding/Scraping)\n\n A continuous, raspy sound - like sand between fingertips:\n\n \n May indicate wear in the joint surface (osteoarthritis)\n\n More common in older people\n\n Not necessarily painful\n\n Can be stable over a long time\n\n \n \n\n \n 3.

About 30% of the population has it. Clicking without pain, locking or functional limitations usually doesn't require treatment.\n\n \n\n \n What happens when the jaw locks?\n\n In jaw lock, the disc sits in front of the condyle and blocks normal opening. You can typically only open 25-30mm compared to normal 40mm+. 95% of acute locks resolve within 12 weeks with conservative treatment.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI of the jaw joint?\n\n Rarely. 33% of completely symptom-free people have disc displacement on MRI, so findings don't necessarily mean disease. MRI is only recommended for serious symptoms that don't respond to treatment or when other pathology is suspected.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need surgery for jaw joint problems?\n\n Very rarely. Surgery is only considered after 6+ months of failed conservative treatment, and studies show that surgically and conservatively treated patients have equally good results after 5 years.\n\n \n\n \n Does clicking get worse over time?\n\n Usually not.

This makes symptomatic Eagle syndrome a rare condition.\n\n \n\n \n Can Eagle syndrome be confused with TMD?\n\n Yes, Eagle syndrome can produce similar symptoms to TMD, including jaw pain, ear pain and headache. Important differences are that Eagle syndrome often causes pain with swallowing and head rotation, and a palpable hard mass in the tonsil area.\n\n \n\n \n How is Eagle syndrome diagnosed?\n\n CT with 3D reconstruction is the gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical examination with intraoral palpation and provocation tests can raise suspicion of the condition.\n\n \n\n \n Can Eagle syndrome be treated?\n\n Yes, conservative treatment with pain relievers and anticonvulsants can be tried first. If ineffective, surgical removal of the styloid process (styloidectomy) can be considered, with 80-90% success rate.\n\n \n\n \n Is Eagle syndrome dangerous?\n\n The vascular variant (stylocarotid syndrome) can be serious as it can compress the carotid artery and cause TIA-like symptoms. This type requires prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent stroke."}]}

But proximity alone does not explain the symptoms - there are three anatomical connections that cause problems in the jaw to be felt in the ear:\n\n \n The Discomalleolar Ligament (Pinto's Ligament)\n\n This is a connective tissue strand that connects the jaw joint's disc directly to the hammer (malleus) in the middle ear. Anatomical studies have demonstrated this ligament in all examined individuals. When the jaw moves abnormally or the disc is displaced, this can pull on the ear bones and cause sound disturbances.\n\n \n\n \n Shared Nerve Supply\n\n The trigeminal nerve supplies both the jaw muscles and two important muscles in the middle ear:\n\n \n Tensor tympani: Controls eardrum tension\n\n Tensor veli palatini: Opens the Eustachian tube\n\n \n When the jaw muscles are chronically tense, this can trigger reflex contraction of the middle ear muscles - which gives a feeling of blocked ear, pressure and tinnitus.\n\n \n\n \n The Auriculotemporal Nerve and Referred Pain\n\n The auriculotemporal nerve supplies both the jaw joint and outer ear canal with sensation. Pain from the jaw joint can therefore be perceived as ear pain through so-called \"referred pain\". You feel the pain in the ear, but the source is in the jaw."}]}

The pain is typically triggered by swallowing, talking or coughing.\n\n \n\n \n What is the difference between glossopharyngeal neuralgia and TMD?\n\n Glossopharyngeal neuralgia causes paroxysmal (seconds-long), lightning-like pain triggered by swallowing, while TMD causes more constant, aching pain triggered by chewing. The pain area is also different - throat/tongue/ear vs. jaw joint/masticatory muscles.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor treat glossopharyngeal neuralgia?\n\n No, glossopharyngeal neuralgia is treated by a neurologist with medications such as carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. The chiropractor's role is to recognize the condition and refer onwards. Neck manipulation should be avoided as it may provoke attacks.\n\n \n\n \n How common is glossopharyngeal neuralgia?\n\n Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is very rare with a prevalence of 0.2-0.8 per 100,000 - about 100 times rarer than trigeminal neuralgia. The condition most often debuts after age 40.\n\n \n\n \n Can glossopharyngeal neuralgia be dangerous?\n\n In 2-10% of patients, pain attacks can trigger bradycardia, asystole or syncope due to vagal involvement.

This includes both benign conditions like carotidynia and serious conditions like carotid dissection.\n\n The term was introduced to gather various causes of pain originating from or involving the carotid artery.\n\n \n Carotid Artery - The Neck Pulse Artery\n\n The carotid arteries are the main blood supply to the brain and face:\n\n \n Common carotid artery: Divides at the level of the larynx (around C4)\n\n Internal carotid artery: Supplies the brain - no branches in the neck\n\n External carotid artery: Supplies face, tongue, pharynx\n\n Carotid sinus: Blood pressure regulating structure at the bifurcation\n\n \n \n\n \n Historical perspective\n\n The term \"carotidynia\" was introduced by Fay in 1927 and used for idiopathic pain from the carotid region. ICHD-3 (International Classification of Headache Disorders) removed carotidynia as a separate diagnosis in 2004 because it often turned out to be a symptom of other pathology. Today the term is used more carefully, and thorough investigation is required."}]}

This means pain signals can cross between areas - neck problems can be perceived as jaw pain and vice versa.\n\n \n\n \n Can forward head posture cause jaw problems?\n\n Yes. When the head pushes forward, the load on neck muscles increases by up to 60%. This postural change activates jaw muscles compensatorily and changes the jaw's resting position. Studies show that 60-66% of office workers have forward head posture.\n\n \n\n \n Can neck injury cause jaw joint problems later?\n\n Yes. Research shows that people with previous neck injury (whiplash) have 5.5 times higher risk of developing TMD. Symptoms can appear weeks to months after the injury itself.\n\n \n\n \n Does neck treatment help jaw pain?\n\n Often yes. Studies show that treatment of upper cervical vertebrae (C0-C2) can reduce jaw pain, and that combined treatment of neck and jaw gives better results than jaw treatment alone."}]}

Keep the teeth 2-3 mm apart. \"Lips together, teeth apart\" is the mantra. This position relieves the jaw joint.\n\n \n\n \n Exercise 2 - Controlled Jaw Opening\n\n With tongue on palate, open and close the jaw slowly and controlled. The movement should be straight up and down, without the jaw sliding to the side.\n\n \n\n \n Exercise 3 - Chin Tuck\n\n Pull the chin straight back, as if making a \"double chin\". Hold for 5-6 seconds. This strengthens the neck muscles and improves head posture.\n\n \n\n \n Exercise 4 - Neck Extension\n\n Combine upper neck flexion (nod down) with lower neck extension (look up). Hold for 5-6 seconds.\n\n \n\n \n Exercise 5 - Shoulder Posture\n\n Pull shoulders back and down. Hold for 5-6 seconds. Good shoulder posture affects the neck and jaw.\n\n \n\n \n Exercise 6 - Isometric Resistance\n\n Place your hand against your chin and press gently while trying to open your mouth.

TMD is a benign condition. About 40% experience spontaneous improvement\n without treatment (AAFP 2015). But persistent problems should be examined å early treatment gives faster\n improvement.\n\n \n\n \n Will the problems come back?\n\n It varies. If you manage stress, improve ergonomics and do exercises regularly,\n relapses are less likely. If you change nothing, the problems often return.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need a bite splint?\n\n Maybe. The splint protects the teeth, but evidence for pain relief is limited. It\n doesn't replace active treatment.\n\n \n\n \n Does neck treatment help the jaw?\n\n Yes, often. 70% of TMD patients have concurrent neck problems. Nerve connections\n mean that treatment of the upper neck can reduce jaw symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need surgery?\n\n Very rarely. Less than 5% need surgery å and then only after prolonged conservative\n treatment without results.\n\n \n\n \n Are clicking sounds dangerous?\n\n Pain-free clicking sounds are almost always harmless. About 33% of the population\n have them. If they're accompanied by pain or locking, you should get it checked."}]}

The result is that the knee \"collapses inward\" with each step - called dynamic knee valgus.\n This overloads the patellofemoral joint and causes pain.\n\n \n\n The biomechanical chain\n\n The body functions as a chain. Weakness or tightness in one place affects the joints above and below:\n \n\n \n Weak hip abduction: Knee collapses inward\n\n Overpronation in the foot: Tibial rotation pulls the kneecap\n\n Tight IT-band: Pulls the kneecap\n laterally\n\n Weak quadriceps: Reduced knee control\n\n \n\n \n \n Why hip training helps\n\n Key insight\n \n\n By strengthening the hip abductors, control over the thighbone improves. The knee tracks better, load\n is distributed more evenly, and pain decreases - even without ever touching the knee itself."}]}

Medically, it is often\n called acute lumbago. The pain typically occurs suddenly, often in connection with a movement such as\n lifting, twisting, or bending, but can also occur without a clear trigger.\n\n The condition is characterized by:\n\n \n Sudden onset pain in the lower back\n\n Stiffness and reduced mobility\n\n Muscle tension that can feel like the back is \"locked\"\n\n Pain often worsens with movement, coughing, or sneezing\n\n \n\n \n Why is it called \"lumbago\"?\n\n The term comes from the Latin word \"lumbus\" meaning loin. Lumbago simply refers to pain in the lumbar\n (lower back) region. Today, we know the causes are quite mundane, but the medical term persists."}]}

Irritation or \"locking\" of these can cause\n sudden pain, especially with certain movements.\n\n \n\n \n Discogenic Pain\n\n The discs between the vertebrae can be a source of pain, even without a herniation.

Studies show that 43% of sequestrations (loose fragments) achieve complete\n resorption. Partial resorption is even more common, with 66-77% showing significant regression.\n\n \n\n \n Can chiropractic cure a herniation?\n\n No, chiropractic does not cure the herniation directly. The body must resorb the\n prolapsed material over time. Treatment can contribute to symptom relief and functional improvement, and\n support the body's natural healing process.\n\n \n\n \n Is chiropractic treatment safe with a herniation?\n\n For most people with uncomplicated herniation, chiropractic treatment is safe when\n performed by a licensed chiropractor. Treatment is adapted to the condition and is not appropriate for\n cauda equina syndrome, progressive neurological deficit, or\n sequestered herniation with severe symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n How long until I notice improvement?\n\n Treatment response varies. Some experience relief after the first treatment, while\n others need several weeks for significant improvement. 85-90% experience improvement within 6-12 weeks.\n Symptom improvement often comes 4-6 weeks before MRI shows changes.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI to get treatment?\n\n No, MRI is usually not necessary for conservative treatment.

The nervous system has become oversensitive and amplifies pain signals.\n\n \n\n \n Is nociplastic pain real pain?\n\n Yes, absolutely. The pain is just as real as any other pain. The difference is that the cause lies in the nervous system's processing of signals, not in detectable tissue damage. Modern brain imaging shows that the pain activates the same brain regions as other types of pain.\n\n \n\n \n Can nociplastic pain be treated?\n\n Yes, but it requires a different approach than traditional pain treatment. Treatment focuses on \"reprogramming\" the nervous system through graded activity, pain education, stress management, and cognitive therapy.\n\n \n\n \n How do I know if I have nociplastic pain?\n\n Typical signs include pain that doesn't match examination findings, widespread pain across multiple areas, hypersensitivity to touch and other stimuli, and pain that doesn't respond to conventional treatment. A thorough clinical evaluation is necessary.\n\n \n\n \n Is central sensitization the same as fibromyalgia?\n\n Fibromyalgia is considered a form of nociplastic pain with central sensitization. However, central sensitization can occur in many conditions, including chronic back pain, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor help with nociplastic pain?\n\n Yes, a chiropractor ..."}]}

It's when back pain is combined with bladder dysfunction,\n groin numbness, unexplained weight loss, fever, or rapidly progressive weakness that you should seek\n prompt help.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor detect serious illness?\n\n Yes. Norwegian chiropractors are licensed healthcare professionals with 5-6 years\n of education. A thorough clinical examination with neurological testing is often more informative than\n imaging. When serious pathology is suspected, the chiropractor has a duty to refer further.\n\n \n\n \n How quickly does cauda equina syndrome develop?\n\n It varies. Some experience gradual worsening over days to weeks, others get sudden\n symptoms. If you have established back pain and develop new symptoms like bladder dysfunction or groin\n numbness, you should seek help immediately."}]}

It starts in the lower back and runs through the buttock\n all the way down to the foot (StatPearls, 2024).\n\n The important thing to understand is that \"sciatica\" is a symptom, not a diagnosis in\n itself. It describes where the pain is felt, but doesn't necessarily say what's causing it.\n\n How common is sciatica?\n\n Despite many believing sciatica is common, true sciatica actually only accounts for 3-5% of all\n back pain cases (StatPearls, 2024).

Long-term\n studies show that conservative treatment gives equally good results as surgery after 6-8 years for\n most patients.\n\n \n\n \n Why do symptoms improve when I sit down?\n\n When you bend your back forward, the spinal canal expands and gives more room\n for the nerves. When you extend backward, the canal becomes narrower. This is why many find it easier\n to cycle than to walk.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI for the diagnosis?\n\n Not necessarily. Clinical examination is often sufficient to make the diagnosis\n and start treatment. Remember that MRI findings often don't correlate with symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n How long does a treatment series last?\n\n Usually 8-12 treatments over 6-12 weeks are recommended as an initial trial\n period. Then the need for maintenance treatment or self-exercise is evaluated.\n\n \n\n \n Can I continue exercising with spinal stenosis?\n\n Absolutely! Activity is important. Cycling, swimming and water aerobics are\n often well tolerated because the body is in a forward-leaning position that opens up the spinal canal."}]}

When the disc between these vertebrae bulges out or ruptures, it can press on the nerve root\n that exits at this level: the C6 nerve.\n\n Cervical radiculopathy (nerve root involvement in the neck) affects approximately 83 per 100,000 people\n annually. The C5-C6 level is involved in about 25% of cases, making it the second most common level\n after C6-C7.\n\n \n Anatomy: The C6 Nerve Root\n\n The C6 nerve supplies specific areas in the arm and hand:\n\n \n Sensory: The thumb, index finger, and outer forearm\n\n Motor: Biceps (bends the elbow) and wrist extensor muscles\n\n Reflex: The brachioradialis reflex (tested on the outer forearm)\n\n \n \n\n Why Does Herniation Occur at the C5-C6 Level?\n\n The C5-C6 segment is one of the most mobile areas in the neck. This high mobility makes the disc more\n susceptible to wear and injury over time. Risk factors include:\n\n \n Prolonged sedentary work with forward head posture\n\n Previous neck injuries (e.g., whiplash)\n\n Genetic predisposition to disc degeneration\n\n Age (most common between 40-50 years)\n\n Smoking (reduces blood supply to the discs)\n\n \n\n \n \n 25%\n of cervical radiculopathy\n \n\n \n 85%\n recover without surgery\n \n\n \n 8-12\n weeks typical recovery time"}]}

Many notice progress after 2-4 weeks. Full recovery can take 3-6 months, and the herniation\n can shrink and be naturally reabsorbed over time.\n\n \n\n \n Can I continue to exercise with C6-C7 disc herniation?\n\n Yes, but with modifications. Avoid heavy overhead lifting, extreme neck\n extension, and exercises that provoke arm pain. Low-intensity cardio, swimming with careful neck\n position, and specific rehabilitation exercises are recommended.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI to confirm C6-C7 disc herniation?\n\n Not routinely. The diagnosis is primarily made clinically based on symptoms and\n examination findings. MRI is only indicated for serious neurological deficits, lack of improvement\n after 6-8 weeks, or if surgery is being considered."}]}

These openings are called \"foramen\" (plural: foramina) and are where the spinal nerves\n leave the spine to supply the arms and hands with sensation and movement.\n\n When the foramen becomes narrower - either due to wear, disc bulging, or bone spurs - the nerve passing\n through can become irritated or compressed. This causes symptoms that radiate from the neck down to the\n shoulder, arm, or hand.\n\n \n Understanding the Anatomy\n\n Think of the foramen as a tunnel through which the nerve\n travels. The tunnel is formed by:\n\n \n The vertebral arch above and below - forming the roof and floor\n\n The facet joint - forming the back wall\n\n The intervertebral disc - forming the front wall\n\n \n Changes in any of these structures can make the tunnel\n narrower and irritate the nerve.\n\n \n\n Most Common Levels\n\n Foraminal stenosis is most common at the following levels in the neck:\n\n \n C5-C6: Affects the C6 nerve - symptoms to\n thumb and index finger\n\n C6-C7: Affects the C7 nerve - symptoms to\n middle and ring finger\n\n C4-C5: Affects the C5 nerve - symptoms to shoulder and upper arm"}]}

A\n \"hard\" herniation with bone spurs is more common in stenosis than \"soft\" disc herniation.\n\n \n\n \n Facet Joint Osteoarthritis\n\n Wear in the facet joints leads to thickening of the joint capsule and bone spurs that reduce space in\n the foramen.\n\n \n\n Risk Factors\n\n \n Age: Risk increases significantly after 50\n\n Previous neck injury: Whiplash or other trauma\n\n Neck-straining work: Prolonged work with head forward or in rotation\n\n Genetics: Some naturally have smaller foramen\n\n Smoking: Accelerates degenerative changes in the spine"}]}

When head is 60 degrees forward, load on neck increases from about 5 kg to 27\n kg.\n\n Can text neck cause headache?\n\n Yes, text neck is a common cause of cervicogenic headache. The constant load on neck muscles and joints\n can cause tension headache that starts in neck and radiates to forehead and temples.\n\n How long does it take to get rid of text neck?\n\n With the right measures, most see improvement within 2-4 weeks. Key is to change mobile habits, do\n regular exercises, and possibly get treatment. Long-standing cases may require longer rehabilitation.\n \n\n Which exercises help with text neck?\n\n The most important exercises are chin tucks (double chin), chest stretches, and shoulder blade\n squeezes. These counteract forward head posture and strengthen muscles that hold head in neutral\n position.\n\n Is text neck dangerous?\n\n Text neck is not dangerous in itself, but prolonged strain can contribute to earlier degenerative\n changes in neck. It's important to address the problem early to avoid it becoming chronic."}]}

In whiplash, this typically occurs after an acceleration-deceleration mechanism\n - such as rear-end collision, falls, or sports injuries.\n\n Between 30-90% of all who experience whiplash develop headache in the acute phase (Al-Khazali et al.,\n 2020). A meta-analysis from 2023 showed that 47% still have headache one year after the injury (Herrero\n Babiloni et al., Pain 2023).\n\n In Northern Sweden, approximately 235 whiplash injuries per 100,000 inhabitants are reported annually\n (Styrke et al., Spine 2012).\n\n The International Headache Classification (ICHD-3, 2018) distinguishes between:\n\n \n Acute PTH\n\n Headache that starts within 7 days of injury and lasts less than 3 months.\n\n \n\n \n Persistent (chronic) PTH\n\n Headache that continues beyond 3 months after the injury.\n\n \n\n The Quebec Task Force classifies whiplash (WAD) into grades from 0-IV, where grades I-II make up\n approximately 90% of all cases.

Facet joint injuries (approx. 60% of chronic cases)\n\n Studies with diagnostic blocks show that the facet joints in the neck are the main source of pain in\n the majority with chronic whiplash (Lord & Barnsley, Spine 1996). The most frequently affected levels\n are C2-C3 (36%) and C5-C6 (35%).\n\n \n\n \n 2. Muscle and ligament injuries\n\n The deep neck muscles and ligaments - especially around the upper cervical joints (C1-C2) - often\n sustain microtrauma. MRI studies have shown fatty infiltration in these muscles after whiplash.\n\n \n\n \n 3. Trigeminocervical convergence\n\n Pain nerves from the neck (C1-C3) meet the trigeminal nerve in the brainstem. This explains why neck\n injury causes headache - pain signals from the neck are \"misinterpreted\" as headache.\n\n \n\n \n 4. Central sensitization\n\n In chronic whiplash, the nervous system can become hypersensitive.

The term\n \"whiplash-associated disorders\" (WAD) is used for symptoms that occur after such an injury. It is\n therefore not a diagnosis in itself, but a description of how the injury occurred.\n\n Rear-end collision in a car is the most common cause, but whiplash can also occur during sports\n accidents, falls, or other situations with rapid movement of the neck. 83% of people involved in\n car accidents experience some degree of whiplash injury (PMC, 2009).\n\n \n Cervical sprain, cervical strain and whiplash - the same condition\n\n The terms \"cervical sprain\" and \"cervical strain\" are often used interchangeably. The Quebec Task\n Force acknowledged as early as 1995 that these conditions cannot be distinguished through clinical\n examination or standard imaging. Theoretically, \"sprain\" refers to ligament damage, while \"strain\"\n describes muscle-tendon injury. In practice, this distinction has no significance for treatment.\n\n \n\n Prevalence\n\n Norway has the world's highest prevalence of neck pain, with 6,151 cases per 100,000 inhabitants\n according to the Global Burden of Disease study. In the Nordic countries, approximately 235-383 people\n per 100,000 are affected by whiplash annually.

The deposits vary in size from small dots to lumps several\n centimeters large.\n\n The condition goes through several phases and is self-limiting - meaning the calcium\n will eventually be reabsorbed by the body.

Understanding which phase you are\n in helps both predict the course and choose the right treatment.\n\n \n Phase 1: Pre-calcification and Formation (Formative phase)\n\n In this phase, normal tendon tissue transforms into fibrocartilage, and calcium begins to deposit.\n The process can take weeks to months.\n\n \n Symptoms: Mild to moderate pain, often vague and diffuse\n\n X-ray: The calcium looks \"fluffy\" or unclear\n\n Duration: Varies from weeks to months\n\n \n \n\n \n Phase 2: Resting Phase (Resting/Chronic phase)\n\n The calcium is fully formed and lies relatively stable in the tendon. This is often the longest phase\n and can last for years.\n\n \n Symptoms: Variable - can be almost symptom-free or cause persistent problems\n\n X-ray: The calcium looks dense and well-defined\n\n Duration: Months to years\n\n \n \n\n \n Phase 3: Resorption (Resorptive phase)\n\n The body begins actively breaking down the calcium. Paradoxically, this is the most painful phase,\n but signals that the condition is resolving.\n\n \n Symptoms: Intense, acute pain - often at night. Dramatically reduced mobility\n \n\n X-ray: The calcium looks \"fluffy\" with unclear borders\n\n Duration: Days to weeks\n\n \n \n\n \n Important to understand\n\n Many patients become worried when the pain suddenly becomes much worse.

When we do, several things\n happen that strain the shoulders:\n\n \n Static muscle work\n\n When you hold your arms in front of you to use the keyboard and mouse, the shoulder muscles\n constantly work to stabilize. Without rest, this leads to fatigue, tension and eventually pain.\n\n \n\n \n Forward-leaning posture\n\n Many lean forward toward the screen. This causes the head to come in front of the shoulders, which\n significantly increases the load on neck and shoulder muscles.\n\n \n\n \n Raised shoulders\n\n Stress, concentration or incorrect desk height causes us to unconsciously raise our shoulders. Over\n time, this leads to chronic tension in the trapezius muscle. This can also affect sleep quality.\n\n \n\n \n One-sided strain\n\n Using the mouse with the same arm all day, the keyboard too far to one side - such asymmetries strain\n one shoulder more than the other. Over time, this can contribute to conditions like biceps tendinopathy or AC\n joint arthritis.\n\n \n\n \n \n 45%\n of office workers have neck/shoulder problems\n \n\n \n 7+ hours\n average computer time per day\n \n\n \n 20 min\n maximum time in the same position"}]}

This means you\n look straight ahead or slightly down, which provides a relaxed neck and shoulder position.\n\n \n\n \n Can mouse use cause shoulder pain?\n\n Yes. If the mouse is placed too far out to the side or too high, you have to\n extend your arm and raise your shoulder. Over time, this can cause tension and pain in the shoulder\n and neck.\n\n \n\n \n How often should I take breaks from computer work?\n\n Ideally, you should take a micro-break (30-60 seconds) every 20-30 minutes, and\n a longer break (5-10 minutes) every hour. Movement and variation are key.\n\n \n\n \n Is a standing desk better for the shoulders?\n\n Variation is more important than whether you sit or stand. A sit-stand desk\n allows you to alternate between positions throughout the day, which is beneficial for both shoulder,\n neck and back.\n\n \n\n \n What exercises can I do at my desk?\n\n Good exercises include shoulder rolls, neck stretches, chest opening and\n shoulder blade squeeze. These only take a few seconds and can be done sitting at your desk.\n\n \n\n \n Does ergonomic equipment help?\n\n Ergonomic equipment (mouse, keyboard, chair) can help, but it's not magic. The\n most important thing is correct setup of what you have, and above all breaks and movement. Expensive\n equipment doesn't replace good habits."}]}

The Norwegian SLAP study (BMJ 2017) showed that surgery was no better\n than sham surgery. 78% of patients with type II SLAP lesion return to sports with conservative\n treatment alone.\n\n \n\n \n How is SLAP lesion diagnosed?\n\n Diagnosis is challenging. Clinical tests have moderate accuracy. MR arthrography\n is the gold standard, but even this has limitations. Many SLAP lesions are incidental findings without\n causing symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n Can I continue throwing with a SLAP lesion?\n\n With proper rehabilitation, many can return to throwing. Focus on rotator cuff\n strength, scapula control and gradual progression is key. Some may need to modify technique or reduce\n intensity.\n\n \n\n \n What is the difference between SLAP lesion and biceps tendinopathy?\n\n SLAP lesion affects the attachment where the biceps tendon attaches to the\n labrum, while biceps tendinopathy affects the tendon itself.\n They can cause similar symptoms and occur together, but SLAP is more associated with overhead sports\n and instability symptoms.\n\n \n\n \n How long does rehabilitation take?\n\n Conservative rehabilitation typically takes 3-6 months. With surgery,\n rehabilitation is longer (4-6 months for return to sports). Full return to throwing sports can take\n 9-12 months after surgery.\n\n \n\n \n Does an MRI finding mean I have a problem?\n\n Not necessarily.

I can examine, diagnose and treat shoulder problems. If you need further investigation or specialist treatment, I can refer you.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an MRI or X-ray first?\n\n Usually not. A thorough clinical examination is often sufficient to make a diagnosis and start treatment. Imaging is only considered if serious injury is suspected or if symptoms don't improve after 6-12 weeks of treatment. It's important to know that findings on MRI don't always explain the pain - many completely pain-free people have rotator cuff changes on imaging.\n\n \n\n \n Does insurance cover treatment?\n\n Most private health insurance covers chiropractic treatment, typically 6-12 treatments per year. Check your own insurance agreement for details.\n\n \n\n \n What if the problems come back?\n\n 40-50% experience recurrence within 1-5 years.

Examples include ankle sprains, muscle tears, and ligament ruptures. These typically cause immediate pain and swelling.\n\n \n\n \n Overuse Injuries\n\n Develop gradually from repetitive stress over time. Examples include tendinopathies (Achilles, patellar), stress fractures, and shin splints. Pain often starts mild and worsens if training continues unchanged.\n\n \n\n Common Sports Injuries\n\n \n Muscle strains: Tears in muscle fibers, often in hamstrings, quads, or calves\n\n Ligament sprains: Stretching or tearing of ligaments, commonly ankle or knee\n\n Tendinopathies: Degeneration of tendons from repetitive loading\n\n Stress fractures: Small cracks in bone from cumulative overload\n\n Joint injuries: Cartilage damage, labral tears, meniscus injuries"}]}

If you experience sudden pain combined with breathing\n difficulties, nausea or cold sweats, you should seek emergency help.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need X-ray or MRI?\n\n Usually not. Imaging is rarely necessary for common pain between the shoulder blades and often shows\n \"normal\" age-related changes that don't explain the symptoms. Clinical examination often provides more\n useful information.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take to get better?\n\n Most people with acute symptoms experience significant improvement within 4-6 weeks. Chronic cases may\n require 8-12 weeks of structured treatment. About 80% follow a favorable course with conservative\n treatment.\n\n \n\n \n Can poor posture cause pain between the shoulder blades?\n\n Prolonged forward-leaning posture overloads the muscles between the shoulder blades and is a common\n contributing factor.

A study in Pain Medicine (2016) found that 93% of patients with chronic\n neck pain had trigger points in the trapezius.\n\n The muscles between the shoulder blades - especially the rhomboids and middle trapezius - often become\n overloaded from prolonged sitting with forward-leaning posture.\n\n \n\n Referred pain from the neck\n\n \n Cervicogenic pain\n\n French orthopedist Robert Maigne described how up to 70% of \"common\" pain between the shoulder blades\n actually originates from the lower neck (C5-C7). The facet joints in the neck can refer pain to the area\n along the medial border of the shoulder blade.\n\n This explains why many experience improvement in shoulder blade pain when the neck is treated.\n \n\n \n\n Thoracic facet joints\n\n \n Facet joint problems\n\n Facet joints in the chest contribute to 34-48% of chronic chest pain according to studies with\n diagnostic blocks (Manchikanti, Pain Physician, 2004; 2020). These small joints between the vertebrae\n can become irritated or worn, especially with repetitive movements or prolonged poor posture. In more\n severe cases, it may involve thoracic disc herniation.\n\n Dreyfuss and colleagues (Spine, 1994) mapped how these joints typically produce pain one segment down\n and slightly to the side.\n\n \n\n Posture-related problems\n\n \n Upper crossed syndrome\n\n Vladimir Janda described in the 1980s what he called \"upper crossed syndrome\": an imbalance where\n anterior muscles (chest, neck) become tight while posterior muscles (rhomboids, middle trapezius) become\n weak and stretched. This pattern can be reinforced by rounded back\n (hyperkyphosis) or conversely by flat back (hypokyphosis).\n\n This pattern is often seen in office workers and creates increased stress in the area between the\n shoulder blades.\n\n \n\n Dorsal scapular nerve\n\n \n An often overlooked cause\n\n Sultan and colleagues (Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 2013) found that 52-62% of\n patients with unilateral pain between the shoulder blades had signs of involvement of this nerve. The\n nerve can become trapped where it passes through the musculature in the neck.\n\n \n\n Visceral referred pain (less common)\n\n \n Internal organs can refer pain\n\n Internal organs can refer pain to the area between the shoulder blades. Gallbladder problems typically\n produce pain to the right shoulder blade, while the pancreas can produce pain to the left. Heart attack\n - especially in women - can present with pain between the shoulder blades rather than classic chest\n pain. For chest pain in front, see also costochondritis.\n\n \n\n Serious pathology (rare)\n\n About 1% of chest pain is due to serious underlying disease. The chest, however, has a higher probability\n of serious pathology than the neck or lower back, making good screening important. In elderly patients, osteoporosis and compression fractures should always be considered, as well\n as Scheuermann's disease in younger people.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n 2\n Symptoms\n\n \n\n Typical presentation varies depending on the cause:\n\n \n With muscular causes\n\n \n Dull, aching pain that is difficult to localize precisely\n\n Worsening with prolonged sitting or repetitive movements\n\n Tender points in the musculature that can trigger familiar pain when pressed\n\n Relief with movement and stretching"}]}

During\n inhalation, it contracts and descends downward. This creates negative pressure in the lungs, and air flows\n in. At the same time, the external intercostal muscles (between the ribs) lift the rib cage outward.\n\n For this to function optimally, the thoracic spine must be mobile. The ribs attach to the vertebrae at\n the back and the sternum at the front. When the thoracic spine becomes stiff - which happens with\n prolonged forward-leaning posture - the ribs cannot rotate freely. With rib\n dislocation or costochondritis, this can become even more\n apparent.\n\n The Numbers Behind the Problem\n\n A Brazilian study (Goncalves et al., 2018) measured diaphragm movement in people with and without\n hyperkyphosis (excessive curvature in the thoracic spine, often called rounded\n back). The result:\n\n \n 35% reduced diaphragmatic movement\n\n In those with a stiff, curved back compared to the control group\n\n \n\n The famous Framingham Study (Lorbergs et al., 2017) followed 275 people over 16 years and found that\n women with the most pronounced kyphosis lost 100 ml more lung capacity than those with\n normal posture - roughly equivalent to the effect of light smoking.\n\n A systematic review from 2024 showed that forward head posture alone reduces forced vital capacity (FVC)\n by 0.25-0.81 liters."}]}

This has led to theories that stiffness in the thoracic\n spine can \"irritate\" these structures and contribute to chronic stress activation. With T4 syndrome, autonomic symptoms are often seen.\n\n \n However, one must be honest about the evidence\n\n The most comprehensive review (Kovanur Sampath et al., 2024) analyzed 14 studies with 618 participants\n and concluded that there is low quality evidence that spinal manipulation affects the\n autonomic nervous system. Measurements of heart rate variability, blood pressure, and stress hormones\n showed no consistent effect.\n\n This doesn't mean the connection between posture and stress is imagined - just that the mechanism is\n probably more complex than direct nerve stimulation.\n\n \n\n Hyperventilation and Exhaustion\n\n A study from Karolinska Institute (Ristiniemi et al., 2014) found a strong correlation between\n hyperventilation and exhaustion syndrome (r=0.77). People with exhaustion had\n significantly higher scores on the Nijmegen Questionnaire for hyperventilation (26.57 vs. 15.14 in healthy\n individuals).\n\n This aligns with clinical experience: Chronic stress changes breathing patterns, which in turn worsens\n the stress response."}]}

The challenge is that the symptoms can resemble heart disease, so it's important to rule out\n serious causes first.\n\n \n\n \n How do you distinguish costochondritis from a heart attack?\n\n Costochondritis typically causes sharp, localized pain that worsens with movement\n and breathing, and can be reproduced by pressing on the area. Heart attack often causes pressing,\n diffuse pain with radiation, accompanied by sweating, nausea and difficulty breathing. When in doubt -\n call emergency services.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor treat costochondritis?\n\n Yes, a chiropractor can assess and treat costochondritis. Treatment focuses on\n restoring normal mobility in the thoracic spine and ribs. Studies show promising results, although the\n evidence base is limited.\n\n \n\n \n How long does it take for costochondritis to resolve?\n\n Most people experience significant improvement within 3-4 weeks with proper\n treatment. Some cases can last up to 1-2 months, and some may have mild symptoms for up to a year.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need X-ray or MRI?\n\n Usually not. Costochondritis is diagnosed clinically. Imaging is primarily used to\n rule out other conditions with atypical symptoms or lack of treatment response.\n\n \n\n \n Can costochondritis come back?\n\n The recurrence rate is relatively low (about 4% over two years).

Grindstaff et al. (Journal of Manual & Manipulative Therapy, 2010) suggest a biomechanical\n explanation: when the joints in the back (facet joints and costovertebral joints) become stiff, the joints\n in the front of the chest must compensate with increased movement. Over time, this can\n irritate the cartilage.\n\n \n Biomechanical Connection\n\n The thoracic spine and ribs form a biomechanical ring - movement in one place affects the entire\n structure. This insight is important for treatment: by restoring normal mobility in the thoracic spine,\n you can often reduce the load on the cartilage connections in front."}]}

EU-OSHA recommends maximum 2 hours of continuous sitting before taking a\n break.\n\n 2.

This overloads neck\n muscles and joints, which can lead to pain between the shoulder\n blades.

A meta-analysis by Gonzalez-Galvez et al. (2019) showed large effect of\n exercise programs on kyphosis angle. Kamali et al. (2016) found that manual therapy provided similar\n improvement as exercise alone - but the combination is often well-documented.\n\n \n Typical Treatment Methods Include\n\n \n Joint mobilization and manipulation of stiff thoracic vertebrae\n\n Soft tissue treatment of tight chest and neck muscles\n\n Specific exercises to strengthen back extensors and shoulder blade stabilizers\n\n Postural guidance and ergonomic advice\n\n \n \n\n Treatment Course\n\n Research indicates that 8-12 weeks of treatment with 2-3 sessions per week yields good results. Expected\n improvement is 5-13 degrees reduction in kyphosis angle (Gonzalez-Galvez et al., 2019;\n Ponzano et al., 2021). Younger patients generally respond better than older ones. The SHEAF study showed\n that improvements from a 3-month exercise program were maintained at 3-year follow-up - provided\n maintenance training continued.\n\n \n Important About Treatment Timing\n\n Treatment should be started early. There's no reason to \"wait and see\" - the sooner you start, the\n better the outlook for improvement."}]}

With a fracture, you remember\n exactly what happened - a fall, a blow, an accident. With dislocation, the history is often more vague.\n The intensity is also different - fractures typically cause more intense pain that makes it difficult to\n take deep breaths. A clinical examination can usually distinguish between the conditions.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need an X-ray to know if my rib is broken?\n\n Not necessarily. Norwegian guidelines state that rib fractures are primarily a\n clinical diagnosis. X-rays also have low accuracy (about 50%) and rarely change treatment for\n uncomplicated fractures. Imaging becomes important when complications are suspected or with serious\n trauma.\n\n \n\n \n Can I exercise with rib dislocation?\n\n Yes, but adapt the activity. Avoid exercises that provoke pain, especially heavy\n rotational movements. Light activity like walking is often perfectly fine. After treatment, you can\n gradually resume normal training.\n\n \n\n \n How long am I on sick leave with rib fractures?\n\n It depends on the nature of the work. For physically demanding work, 4-6 weeks may\n be necessary. For sedentary work, many can return earlier, but with adjustments. As a chiropractor, I\n can write sick leave for up to 12 weeks.\n\n \n\n \n Why does it hurt so much to breathe?\n\n The nerves that run along the ribs (intercostal nerves) become irritated with both\n fractures a..."}]}

A study by\n Nesbit and Serrano from 2005 showed that the back and hip joints together account for 68-72% of\n the total work in a golf swing.\n\n Modern golf technique is built on what is called the \"X-factor\" - the angle between shoulders and pelvis\n at the top of the backswing. Skilled golfers create around 30-60 degrees of separation between upper and\n lower body, depending on measurement method (Cole and Grimshaw, 2016). This \"coils\" the muscles and stores\n elastic energy that is released in the downswing.\n\n \n But what happens when the thoracic spine is stiff?\n\n Then the lumbar spine must compensate with more rotation than it is designed for. And the lumbar spine\n has only 1-2 degrees of rotational capacity per vertebra - compared to the thoracic vertebrae's 4-9\n degrees.\n\n \n\n The result is predictable: Lower back pain is the most common injury among golfers.\n Epidemiological studies show that 15-34% of amateurs and 22-24% of professionals experience golf-related\n back injury (McHardy et al., 2007). Combined, lower back problems account for 18-54% of all golf-related\n complaints.\n\n \n 3x Higher Lifetime Risk\n\n Professional golfers have three times higher lifetime risk of lower back injury compared to amateurs\n (Kay et al., 2024)."}]}

Kibler and colleagues established as\n early as 1995 that legs, hips, and trunk together contribute approximately 51% of kinetic energy\n and 54% of total force in a serve. The rest comes from shoulder, arm, and wrist.\n\n A stiff thoracic spine limits how much energy can be generated and transferred through this chain. The\n shoulder must then compensate with higher velocity to achieve the same result - and this increases load\n and injury risk.\n\n \n The Good News from Research\n\n A study published in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living (Le Solliec et al., 2023) followed 22\n competitive tennis players through an 8-week program of stretching, strength, and mobilization\n exercises:\n\n \n The percentage of successful serves increased from 41% to 55%\n\n Serve velocity and accuracy improved significantly (effect size 0.54-0.65)\n\n Shoulder mobility increased markedly, especially external rotation (effect size 1.49)\n\n \n The program focused on thoracic and shoulder mobility combined with strength exercises - four\n sessions per week for eight weeks.

Only 0.25-0.75% of all symptomatic disc herniations occur in the\n thoracic spine. In comparison, the lumbar spine accounts for about 90% and the cervical spine for about\n 8%.\n\n \n\n \n Can a chiropractor treat thoracic disc herniation?\n\n The chiropractor's main role is to identify the condition and assess severity. For\n confirmed herniation without neurological deficits, gentle treatment of surrounding structures may be\n considered. With myelopathic signs, the patient is referred onward.\n\n \n\n \n Why does it take so long to get a diagnosis?\n\n Symptoms can resemble heart disease, lung conditions, or gastrointestinal\n problems. Average delay is 14-16 months from symptom onset to correct diagnosis.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need surgery?\n\n Most people don't need surgery. About 73-80% recover with conservative treatment.\n Surgery is indicated for progressive neurological symptoms or lack of improvement after 6-12 weeks.\n \n\n \n\n \n Are MRI findings always significant?\n\n No. 37% of healthy people without symptoms have disc bulges in the thoracic spine\n on MRI. Imaging findings must always be interpreted together with symptoms and clinical findings.\n\n \n\n \n Can the condition resolve on its own?\n\n Symptoms can improve, but spontaneous regression of the actual herniation is very\n rarely documented for thoracic cases - unlike lumbar herniations.\n\n \n\n \n Which sports increase the risk?\n\n Sports with repetitive rotation suc..."}]}

You may experience pain between the shoulder blades, around the ribs, or pain radiating to the chest. Pain often worsens with deep breathing, coughing, or rotating movements.\n \n\n \n\n \n Can thoracic back pain cause chest pain?\n\n \n Yes, thoracic back pain can definitely cause chest pain. The nerve roots exiting from the thoracic spine innervate the area around the ribs and chest. Conditions like costochondritis, rib dysfunction, or thoracic dysfunction can all cause pain felt in the chest but originating in the back.\n \n\n \n\n \n How do you distinguish thoracic back pain from heart problems?\n\n \n Musculoskeletal chest pain is often reproducible with pressure or movement, localized to one point, and worsens with breathing or rotation. Heart pain is often diffuse, accompanied by breathing difficulty, sweating or nausea, and is not related to movement. When in doubt, seek medical attention immediately.\n \n\n \n\n \n Is thoracic back pain dangerous?\n\n \n Most thoracic back pain is caused by harmless muscle and joint problems like rib dysfunction or muscle tension.

May feel like tiredness or a burning sensation in the muscles.\n\n Sharp pain with movement or breathing - Typical for rib dysfunction or irritation in the joints between ribs and spine. Can make it painful to take deep breaths.\n\n Morning stiffness - Feeling of reduced mobility, especially with rotation. Often improves after you've moved around a bit.\n\n Radiation along the ribs - Pain that follows the rib course from the back and forward towards the sternum. This can be frightening but usually has a harmless cause.\n\n Feeling of not getting enough air - When the thoracic spine is stiff, rib movement is restricted. This can give a feeling of tightness in the chest without anything being wrong with the lungs."}]}

Here I review the causes from most to least common:\n\n Common Causes (90%+ of cases)\n\n \n Prolonged Sitting and \"Office Back\"\n\n People sit more than ever. Studies show that prolonged sitting (over 7 hours daily) is associated with reduced mobility in the thoracic spine and increased risk of pain. A forward-leaning posture in front of a PC or mobile phone significantly increases the load on the upper back muscles.\n\n Among office workers, up to 34% report upper back complaints within a year (Briggs et al., 2009).\n\n \n\n \n Stress and Breathing Patterns - The \"Invisible\" Cause\n\n Stress often manifests physically in the body. With high stress, breathing patterns change to become more shallow - so-called chest breathing. This overloads the accessory muscles in the neck and thoracic spine.\n\n The result is a vicious cycle: Tension leads to pain, pain leads to altered breathing patterns, altered breathing leads to more tension.\n\n \n\n \n Joint Dysfunction (Facet Joints and Costovertebral Joints)\n\n Stiff or irritated joints in the spine or where the ribs attach can cause sharp, localised pain. Many call this \"rib lock\" - a condition that responds well to treatment.\n\n \n\n \n Posture-Related Problems\n\n Increased kyphosis (forward-leaning posture) puts unnecessary strain on the thoracic spine.

You can come directly to me without a GP referral.\n\n Examination\n\n The first consultation always starts with a thorough review of your medical history and a clinical examination. I map mobility, muscle tension and neurological conditions to find the cause of the pain and rule out conditions requiring other follow-up.\n\n Treatment Methods\n\n Treatment is tailored to the individual, but may include:\n\n \n Joint Manipulation/Mobilisation\n\n Specific techniques to restore normal joint function. A systematic review (Gevers-Montoro et al., 2022) shows that thoracic manipulation has significant effect on pain and function compared to mobilisation alone.\n\n \n\n \n Soft Tissue Treatment\n\n Massage, trigger point treatment or instrument-assisted treatment to loosen tight muscles.\n\n \n\n \n Exercises and Guidance\n\n Specific exercises to strengthen and stabilise, as well as advice on ergonomics and work posture.\n\n \n\n \n Breathing Guidance\n\n For stress-related complaints, conscious work on breathing patterns can be an important part of treatment.\n\n \n\n \n What can you expect? Many experience improvement within 3-6 treatments, but this varies based on how long you've had complaints and your general health.

Here are three exercises that can relieve stiffness in the thoracic spine:\n\n \n 1. Cat-Camel\n\n Start on all fours. Round your back up while exhaling (like an angry cat), then arch your back while inhaling. Repeat calmly 10-15 times. Good for mobility throughout the spine.\n\n \n\n \n 2. Thread the Needle\n\n Lie on your side with bent knees. Stretch your top arm forward, then guide it in an arc over your head and backwards while following your hand with your gaze. Hold for a few seconds and feel the stretch in your chest. 10 repetitions on each side.\n\n \n\n \n 3. Thoracic Extension Over Foam Roller\n\n Lie with your thoracic spine over a foam roller (avoid the lower back). Hold your hands behind your head and lean back gently. Roll carefully back and forth. 1-2 minutes daily.\n\n \n\n \n Tips\n\n Do the exercises daily for 2-3 weeks for best effect. Stop if the exercises worsen your pain."}]}

When in doubt, contact a doctor.\n\n \n\n \n Do I need X-ray or MRI?\n\n Rarely. Imaging is only necessary when there's suspicion of serious underlying cause (red flags). For most musculoskeletal complaints, clinical examination provides sufficient information.\n\n \n\n \n How long do the complaints last?\n\n Acute complaints often improve within 2-6 weeks. For chronic complaints (over 12 weeks), it may take longer, and a combination of treatment and self-effort is important.\n\n \n\n \n Can stress cause back pain?\n\n Yes, absolutely. Mental stress leads to increased muscle tension and altered breathing patterns, which in turn can cause physical pain in the neck and thoracic spine. The connection is well documented.\n\n \n\n \n Should I rest or be active?\n\n Moderate activity is usually better than bed rest. Movement promotes blood circulation and prevents muscles from stiffening further."}]}

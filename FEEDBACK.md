# ChiroClick CRM - Feedback Guide

Thanks for testing! Your honest feedback is the most valuable thing you can give.

## How to Give Feedback

Pick the method that works best for you:

### Option A: Quick Voice Note (Easiest)

Record a 2-3 minute voice note on your phone while you use the app.
Just talk through what you're doing, what confuses you, and what feels good.
Send it to me on [WhatsApp/Signal/etc].

### Option B: Fill This Checklist

Rate each area 1-5 (1 = frustrating, 5 = smooth):

**First Impression (first 5 minutes)**

- [ ] \_/5 — How easy was INSTALL.bat to run?
- [ ] \_/5 — How easy was START-CHIROCLICK.bat?
- [ ] \_/5 — Did the login screen make sense?
- [ ] \_/5 — First impression of the dashboard?
- [ ] Free text: What confused you in the first 5 minutes?
  >

**Creating a Patient**

- [ ] \_/5 — Finding where to add a new patient
- [ ] \_/5 — The form (too many fields? too few? confusing labels?)
- [ ] \_/5 — Saving and finding the patient again
- [ ] Free text: What would you change about the patient form?
  >

**Clinical Encounter (THE CORE)**

- [ ] \_/5 — Starting a new encounter
- [ ] \_/5 — Writing SOAP notes (does the layout make sense?)
- [ ] \_/5 — AI suggestions (helpful or annoying?)
- [ ] \_/5 — Spine palpation clicks (intuitive?)
- [ ] \_/5 — Saving/signing the encounter
- [ ] Free text: What was the biggest friction point?
  >

**Overall**

- [ ] \_/5 — Would you actually use this in your practice?
- [ ] \_/5 — How "heavy" does it feel? (1=overwhelming, 5=just right)
- [ ] \_/5 — Navigation — can you find things?
- [ ] \_/5 — Speed — does it feel fast enough?
- [ ] Free text: The ONE thing that would make you use this daily?
  >
- [ ] Free text: The ONE thing that would make you NOT use this?
  >

### Option C: Just Text Me

Send me a message after you've used it for 15 minutes.
No structure needed — just your gut feeling.

## What to Test (Suggested Path)

1. **Start the app** (double-click START-CHIROCLICK.bat)
2. **Login** (admin@chiroclickcrm.no / admin123)
3. **Create a patient** (make up a test patient)
4. **Do a clinical encounter** (this is the main feature)
   - Write a chief complaint
   - Try the AI SOAP suggestion (click the AI button)
   - Try the spine palpation sidebar (click spine segments)
   - Try adding diagnosis codes
   - Save the encounter
5. **Browse around** — Exercises, CRM, Settings
6. **Try creating a second encounter** for the same patient

## What I'm Most Worried About

Be extra honest about:

- **Is it too complex?** Too many buttons/options?
- **Does the clinical flow match how you actually work?**
- **Is the Norwegian text natural?** (AI-generated labels, clinical terms)
- **Would you trust the AI suggestions?** Or do they feel unreliable?

## Known Limitations

- This is a beta — some features are stubs (billing, kiosk mode)
- AI needs Ollama running (14GB RAM) — skip AI if your machine is slow
- No cloud sync — everything is local to your machine
- Data is only on YOUR computer — don't put real patient data in this beta

Using Video Nystagmography (VNG) from Interacoustics to differentiate nystagmus,

Types of Nystagmus:

Physiological Nystagmus:

End-point nystagmus

Optokinetic nystagmus

Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

Physiological Nystagmus: This refers to normal, expected forms of nystagmus that occur in healthy individuals. These types of nystagmus serve important functions in maintaining clear vision and balance.

a) End-point nystagmus:

Definition: A jerk nystagmus that occurs when the eyes are held in extreme lateral gaze (typically beyond 30 degrees).

Characteristics:

The fast phase is in the direction of gaze

Low amplitude, low frequency

Fatigues quickly (disappears after a few beats)

More common and prominent in darkness

Function: Believed to be a result of the "elastic restoring forces" of the eye muscles when stretched to their limits.

Clinical significance: Generally considered normal if it's symmetrical, low amplitude, and occurs only at extreme gaze. Asymmetry or occurrence at less extreme gaze positions may indicate pathology.

b) Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN):

Definition: A reflexive eye movement in response to large-scale movement in the visual field.

Characteristics:

Consists of smooth pursuit (slow phase) in the direction of visual field movement, followed by a quick saccade (fast phase) in the opposite direction

Can be sustained as long as the visual stimulus continues

Symmetrical in normal individuals

Function: Helps stabilize gaze on objects when the head or environment is in motion (e.g., looking out the window of a moving vehicle).

Clinical significance: Asymmetries or absence of OKN can indicate vestibular or neurological disorders.

c) Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR):

Definition: While not nystagmus per se, VOR is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement.

Characteristics:

Eyes move in the opposite direction of head movement

Very rapid response (less than 10 ms latency)

Can be horizontal, vertical, or torsional depending on the plane of head movement

Function: Maintains visual fixation during head movements, allowing clear vision even when the head is in motion.

Clinical significance:

VOR can be assessed through various tests including head impulse test, rotational chair testing, and caloric testing.

Impaired VOR can result in oscillopsia (visual blurring during head movement) and imbalance.

Hyperactive VOR can produce pathological nystagmus.

It's important to note that while these forms of nystagmus are physiological, they can be altered in various vestibular and neurological disorders. For instance:

Impaired smooth pursuit can affect optokinetic nystagmus.

Vestibular disorders can alter the VOR, potentially producing pathological nystagmus.

Central nervous system disorders can affect all these reflexes, often in complex ways.





Pathological Nystagmus:

Spontaneous nystagmus

Positional nystagmus

Gaze-evoked nystagmus

Caloric-induced nystagmus

Pathological Nystagmus: This refers to abnormal eye movements that indicate underlying vestibular or neurological disorders. These types of nystagmus are not typically present in healthy individuals and often suggest specific pathologies.

a) Spontaneous nystagmus:

Definition: Involuntary eye movements that occur without any provocation, typically when the head is in a neutral position.

Characteristics:

Can be horizontal, vertical, or torsional

Usually jerk nystagmus (fast phase in one direction, slow phase in the other)

May be suppressed by visual fixation in peripheral vestibular disorders

Clinical significance:

In acute peripheral vestibular disorders (e.g., vestibular neuritis), it typically beats away from the affected side

In central disorders, it may be pure vertical, torsional, or direction-changing

The presence of spontaneous nystagmus often indicates an acute or uncompensated vestibular imbalance

b) Positional nystagmus:

Definition: Nystagmus triggered or modulated by changes in head position relative to gravity.

Characteristics:

Can be direction-fixed (beats in the same direction regardless of head position) or direction-changing

May have a latency period after position change

Often fatigable (decreases with repeated positioning)

Clinical significance:

Classic sign of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)

Direction, latency, and duration help differentiate between canal types in BPPV

Can also occur in central positional vertigo

c) Gaze-evoked nystagmus:

Definition: Nystagmus that occurs when the eyes are held eccentrically (away from primary position).

Characteristics:

Typically beats in the direction of gaze

May be unidirectional or bidirectional

Often more prominent in horizontal gaze, but can occur in vertical gaze as well

Clinical significance:

Unidirectional gaze-evoked nystagmus can indicate an acute peripheral vestibular disorder

Bidirectional gaze-evoked nystagmus often suggests central pathology (e.g., cerebellar dysfunction)

Can be a side effect of certain medications (e.g., anticonvulsants)

Posterior Canal BPPV (most common, ~80-90% of cases):

Direction: Upbeat and torsional (top pole of the eye beating towards the affected ear)

Latency: 1-5 seconds after position change

Duration: 5-30 seconds

Provoked by: Dix-Hallpike maneuver

Other features:

Reversal of nystagmus direction when returning to sitting

Fatigable with repeated testing

Horizontal (Lateral) Canal BPPV (~5-15% of cases):

a) Geotropic variant (more common):

Direction: Horizontal, beating towards the ground in both lateral positions

Latency: 0-5 seconds

Duration: 15-60 seconds

Provoked by: Supine roll test (head turn to either side while supine)

Other features:

Stronger nystagmus when affected ear is down

b) Apogeotropic variant:

Direction: Horizontal, beating away from the ground in both lateral positions

Latency: 0-5 seconds

Duration: Can be longer, sometimes > 1 minute

Provoked by: Supine roll test

Other features:

Stronger nystagmus when unaffected ear is down

Anterior Canal BPPV (rare, ~1-2% of cases):

Direction: Downbeat with a small torsional component

Latency: 1-5 seconds

Duration: Usually < 30 seconds

Provoked by: Dix-Hallpike maneuver (often on either side)

Other features:

Can be difficult to differentiate from central causes of downbeat nystagmus



Cupulolithiasis vs Canalithiasis in BPPV

Basic Definitions

Canalithiasis

Free-floating otoconia (debris) within the semicircular canal

Otoconia move freely in the endolymph

Most common form of BPPV

Cupulolithiasis

Otoconia adherent to the cupula (sensory receptor)

Debris attached rather than free-floating

Less common form of BPPV

Key Differences

1. Nystagmus Characteristics

Canalithiasis:

Latency period (1-5 seconds)

Transient nystagmus (lasting 5-30 seconds)

Fatigable with repeated positioning

Clear crescendo-decrescendo pattern

Cupulolithiasis:

No latency or minimal latency

Persistent nystagmus (>1 minute)

Less fatigable

More constant intensity

2. Symptoms

Canalithiasis:

Brief episodes of vertigo

Clear start and end to episodes

Symptoms triggered by position changes

Better between episodes

Cupulolithiasis:

More persistent vertigo

Continuous symptoms in provoking position

More severe symptoms

Less relief between episodes

3. Common Locations

Canalithiasis:

Most common in posterior canal

Can occur in any canal

Typically responds well to repositioning

Cupulolithiasis:

More common in horizontal canal

Can present as apogeotropic horizontal canal BPPV

Can be more resistant to treatment

Clinical Testing

1. Posterior Canal

Canalithiasis:

Positive Dix-Hallpike with classic delayed onset

Transient upbeat-torsional nystagmus

Returns to normal within 30 seconds

Cupulolithiasis:

Immediate onset with Dix-Hallpike

More persistent nystagmus

May continue as long as position is maintained

2. Horizontal Canal

Canalithiasis:

Geotropic direction-changing nystagmus

Stronger when affected ear is down

Transient duration

Cupulolithiasis:

Apogeotropic direction-changing nystagmus

Stronger when unaffected ear is down

More persistent duration

Treatment Approaches

1. Canalithiasis Treatment:

Standard repositioning maneuvers effective

Epley maneuver for posterior canal

Lempert (BBQ) roll for horizontal canal

Often resolves with single treatment

Better success rate

2. Cupulolithiasis Treatment:

May require modified maneuvers

Longer maintenance of positions

Multiple treatments often needed

Consider vibration to help dislodge particles

May need forceful movements

Lower success rate initially

Follow-up Considerations

Canalithiasis:

Usually resolves within 1-3 treatments

Clear resolution of symptoms

Lower recurrence rate

Cupulolithiasis:

May require multiple treatment sessions

Gradual improvement more common

Higher recurrence rate

May need home exercises

Prevention Strategies

Both Types:

Sleep with head elevated

Avoid quick head movements

Be careful with head position during activities

Regular follow-up if symptoms recur

Red Flags

For both conditions, consider central causes if:

Atypical nystagmus patterns

Additional neurological symptoms

Failed response to appropriate treatment

Symptoms inconsistent with BPPV



Key Differentiating Factors:

Direction:

Torsional component suggests posterior or anterior canal

Pure horizontal suggests horizontal canal

Downbeat component suggests anterior canal or central cause

Latency:

Short latency (0-5 seconds) is typical for all BPPV types

Immediate onset (no latency) may suggest central pathology

Duration:

Brief duration (typically < 1 minute) is characteristic of BPPV

Horizontal canal BPPV often has longer duration than posterior canal

Nystagmus persisting > 1 minute may suggest central pathology

Fatigability:

BPPV nystagmus typically fatigues with repeated testing

Non-fatigable nystagmus may indicate central pathology

Vertigo Intensity:

Usually more severe in horizontal canal BPPV compared to posterior canal

Reversibility:

Reversal of nystagmus direction when returning to sitting position is typical of posterior canal BPPV

Additional Considerations:

Multi-canal BPPV: Can present with mixed characteristics

Central positional vertigo: May mimic BPPV but often has atypical features (e.g., purely vertical nystagmus, lack of fatigability)

Subjective BPPV: Patients report typical symptoms but no observable nystagmus

Vertical beats in BPPV can indeed be significant and help in identifying the affected canal. Let's break this down by canal and side:

Posterior Canal BPPV:

Upbeat vertical component:

Present in combination with torsional nystagmus

More prominent when the affected ear is down during the Dix-Hallpike test

Right posterior canal: Upbeat and clockwise torsional (from patient's perspective)

Left posterior canal: Upbeat and counterclockwise torsional

Significance: The upbeat component helps confirm posterior canal involvement and differentiate it from horizontal canal BPPV.

Anterior Canal BPPV:

Downbeat vertical component:

Primary direction is downbeat, with a small torsional component

Can be seen with either ear down during the Dix-Hallpike test

Right anterior canal: Downbeat with a small counterclockwise torsional component

Left anterior canal: Downbeat with a small clockwise torsional component

Significance: The predominant downbeat nystagmus is a key feature of anterior canal BPPV, though it's important to rule out central causes of downbeat nystagmus.

Horizontal (Lateral) Canal BPPV:

Typically no vertical component

Purely horizontal nystagmus during the supine roll test

Significance: The absence of a vertical component helps differentiate horizontal canal BPPV from posterior or anterior canal involvement.

Multi-canal BPPV:

May show mixed characteristics

For example, a combination of upbeat-torsional and horizontal nystagmus could indicate involvement of both posterior and horizontal canals

Key Points:

Direction of vertical component:

Upbeat: Suggests posterior canal BPPV

Downbeat: Suggests anterior canal BPPV or central pathology

Accompanying torsional component:

Helps determine which side is affected in posterior and anterior canal BPPV

Provocation maneuver:

Dix-Hallpike test: Primarily for posterior and anterior canal BPPV

Supine roll test: For horizontal canal BPPV

Intensity of vertical component:

Usually stronger when the affected ear is down in posterior canal BPPV

May be similar on both sides in anterior canal BPPV

Central mimics:

Pure vertical nystagmus (especially downbeat) without a torsional component may suggest central pathology

Conversion phenomenon:

Sometimes, treatment of one canal can lead to particle migration to another canal, changing the nystagmus characteristics

Diagnostic Pearls:

Always observe for both vertical and torsional components in posterior and anterior canal BPPV.

The side with more intense nystagmus during Dix-Hallpike is usually the affected side in posterior canal BPPV.

Anterior canal BPPV is rare and should be diagnosed cautiously, especially if downbeat nystagmus is persistent or not paroxysmal.

In cases of atypical or persistent vertical nystagmus, consider central causes and potential need for neuroimaging.

Horizontal (Lateral) Canal BPPV:

Geotropic Variant (more common):

Direction: Horizontal nystagmus beating towards the ground (geotropic) in both lateral head positions

Stronger when: Affected ear is down

Mechanism: Typically canalithiasis (free-floating particles in the canal)

Apogeotropic Variant:

Direction: Horizontal nystagmus beating away from the ground (apogeotropic) in both lateral head positions

Stronger when: Unaffected ear is down

Mechanism: Often cupulolithiasis (particles adherent to the cupula) or canalithiasis in the ampullary arm of the canal

Key Characteristics of Horizontal Canal BPPV:

Provocation:

Supine roll test: Patient lies supine with head elevated 30°, then quickly turned to each side

Bow and lean test: Can help determine the affected side

Latency:

Often minimal or no latency (0-2 seconds)

Duration:

Typically longer than posterior canal BPPV, often 30-60 seconds or more

Intensity:

Often more intense than posterior canal BPPV, with more severe vertigo

Nystagmus pattern:

Direction-changing: Nystagmus changes direction based on head position

Pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus: May be present even in upright position

Affected side determination:

Geotropic: Stronger nystagmus when affected ear is down

Apogeotropic: Stronger nystagmus when unaffected ear is down

Null point:

Position where nystagmus stops or is minimal, usually with affected ear slightly up

Diagnostic Pearls:

Horizontal nystagmus during Dix-Hallpike test may indicate horizontal canal involvement.

The side with more intense nystagmus in geotropic variant is usually the affected side.

Apogeotropic variant can convert to geotropic with repeated positioning.

"Pseudo-spontaneous" nystagmus may be observed in the sitting position due to the 30° inclination of the horizontal canal.

Differential Diagnosis:

Central causes: Consider if nystagmus is purely vertical, doesn't fatigue, or has other atypical features

Vestibular neuritis: Can cause horizontal nystagmus, but it's unidirectional and not position-dependent

Meniere's disease: Can cause horizontal nystagmus during acute attacks

Treatment Considerations:

Geotropic variant: Lempert (BBQ roll) maneuver or Gufoni maneuver

Apogeotropic variant: Modified Lempert maneuver, Gufoni maneuver, or forced prolonged positioning

Important Notes:

Horizontal canal BPPV can be more challenging to treat than posterior canal BPPV.

Some patients may have involvement of multiple canals, complicating the presentation.

Horizontal nystagmus that doesn't fit the typical BPPV pattern should prompt consideration of central causes.



d) Caloric-induced nystagmus: teptrature graded cold or hot in the ear 

Definition: Nystagmus produced by thermal stimulation of the lateral semicircular canal during caloric testing.

Characteristics:

Typically horizontal nystagmus

Direction depends on the temperature of stimulation and the ear being tested

Should be symmetrical between left and right ears in normal individuals

Clinical significance:

Asymmetry between ears can indicate unilateral peripheral vestibular weakness

Absent response bilaterally suggests bilateral vestibular loss

Perverted (vertical) nystagmus during caloric testing may indicate central pathology

Key points for interpretation:

Direction: The direction of nystagmus often provides clues about the location of the lesion.

Peripheral Vestibular Lesions:

a) Acute Unilateral Peripheral Vestibulopathy (e.g., vestibular neuritis):

Direction: Horizontal-torsional nystagmus beating away from the affected side

Example: Right-beating nystagmus indicates a left-sided lesion

b) Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV):

Posterior canal: Upbeat and torsional, top pole beating towards the affected ear

Horizontal canal (geotropic): Horizontal, beats towards the ground in both lateral positions

Horizontal canal (apogeotropic): Horizontal, beats away from the ground in both lateral positions

Anterior canal: Downbeat with a small torsional component



The terms "geotropic" and "apogeotropic" are primarily used in the context of horizontal (lateral) canal BPPV. They describe the direction of the nystagmus in relation to the ground during positional testing. Let's break down the differences:

Geotropic Horizontal Canal BPPV:

Definition: "Geo" means earth, and "tropic" means turning towards. In this case, the nystagmus beats towards the ground.

Nystagmus characteristics:

The fast phase of nystagmus beats towards the ground (earth) in both left and right lateral positions.

Stronger when the affected ear is down.

Mechanism:

Usually caused by free-floating debris (otoconia) in the posterior arm of the horizontal canal (canalithiasis).

During supine roll test:

When lying on the affected side: Strong nystagmus beating towards the ground (affected ear).

When lying on the unaffected side: Weaker nystagmus still beating towards the ground (unaffected ear).

Treatment:

Typically responds well to the Lempert (BBQ roll) maneuver or Gufoni maneuver.

Apogeotropic Horizontal Canal BPPV:

Definition: "Apo" means away from, so the nystagmus beats away from the ground.

Nystagmus characteristics:

The fast phase of nystagmus beats away from the ground in both left and right lateral positions.

Stronger when the unaffected ear is down.

Mechanism:

Often caused by debris attached to the cupula (cupulolithiasis) or in the anterior arm of the canal.

During supine roll test:

When lying on the affected side: Weaker nystagmus beating away from the ground (towards the ceiling).

When lying on the unaffected side: Stronger nystagmus beating away from the ground (towards the ceiling).

Treatment:

Can be more challenging to treat than geotropic type.

May respond to modified Lempert maneuver, Gufoni maneuver for apogeotropic BPPV, or forced prolonged positioning.

Key Differences:

Direction of nystagmus: Towards the ground in geotropic; away from the ground in apogeotropic.

Intensity based on position:

Geotropic: Stronger when affected ear is down.

Apogeotropic: Stronger when unaffected ear is down.

Likely location of otoconia:

Geotropic: Usually in the posterior arm of the canal.

Apogeotropic: Often attached to the cupula or in the anterior arm.

Ease of treatment:

Geotropic is generally easier to treat.

Apogeotropic can be more stubborn and may require multiple treatment sessions.

Conversion:

Apogeotropic can sometimes convert to geotropic with repeated positioning or over time.



Central Vestibular Lesions:

a) Pure Vertical Nystagmus:

Downbeat: Often indicates lesions in the cervicomedullary junction or cerebellum

Upbeat: Can indicate lesions in the medulla or midbrain

b) Pure Torsional Nystagmus:

Often indicates lesions in the medulla (e.g., lateral medullary syndrome)

c) Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus:

Bidirectional: Often indicates cerebellar dysfunction

d) Pendular Nystagmus:

Can indicate lesions in the brainstem or cerebellum

Other Patterns:

a) See-saw Nystagmus:

One eye elevates and intorts while the other depresses and extorts

Can indicate parasellar lesions or visual pathway abnormalities

b) Periodic Alternating Nystagmus:

Horizontal nystagmus that changes direction every 1-2 minutes

Often indicates cerebellar nodulus lesions

Key Points for Interpretation:

Peripheral vs. Central:

Peripheral nystagmus is typically unidirectional and horizontal or horizontal-torsional

Central nystagmus can be purely vertical, purely torsional, or multidirectional

Alexander's Law:

In peripheral lesions, nystagmus typically increases in intensity when looking in the direction of the fast phase

This pattern may not hold true in central lesions

Fixation Effect:

Peripheral nystagmus often suppresses with visual fixation

Central nystagmus may persist or even increase with fixation

Associated Symptoms:

Peripheral lesions often have severe vertigo, nausea, and imbalance

Central lesions may have additional neurological symptoms

Central lesions affecting the brainstem, cerebellum, or other parts of the central nervous system can cause vertigo or dizziness along with other neurological symptoms. These additional symptoms can include:

Cranial Nerve Dysfunction:

Double vision (diplopia)

Facial numbness or weakness

Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)

Hoarseness or changes in voice

Hearing loss or tinnitus (if involving the 8th cranial nerve)

Motor Symptoms:

Weakness or paralysis, often on one side of the body (hemiparesis)

Clumsiness or poor coordination (ataxia)

Tremors or involuntary movements

Sensory Symptoms:

Numbness or tingling sensations (paresthesia)

Loss of sensation in parts of the body

Altered perception of pain or temperature

Visual Disturbances:

Nystagmus that doesn't fit the typical pattern for BPPV

Visual field defects

Oscillopsia (a visual disturbance where objects appear to jump or jiggle)

Cognitive and Speech Issues:

Difficulty speaking (dysarthria) or understanding speech (aphasia)

Memory problems

Confusion or altered mental status

Balance and Coordination Problems:

Severe gait instability not explained by the degree of vertigo alone

Inability to stand or walk without support

Past-pointing or dysmetria (inability to judge distance or scale of movement)

Autonomic Symptoms:

Changes in blood pressure or heart rate

Sweating abnormalities

Bladder or bowel dysfunction

Headache:

Severe, sudden-onset headache (could indicate a vascular event)

New type of headache, especially if associated with other neurological symptoms

Consciousness Disturbances:

Loss of consciousness

Altered level of consciousness

Other Specific Signs:

Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis)

Cerebellar signs (e.g., intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia)

Key Points:

The presence of these symptoms alongside vertigo or dizziness suggests a central rather than peripheral cause.

Central lesions often produce more persistent symptoms compared to the typically intermittent nature of BPPV.

The pattern of nystagmus in central lesions may be purely vertical, purely torsional, or may not follow the typical patterns seen in BPPV.

Any red flag symptoms (such as sudden severe headache, acute onset of neurological deficits, or altered consciousness) warrant immediate medical attention and imaging studies.





Time Course:

Acute peripheral lesions often show a gradual reduction in nystagmus intensity over days to weeks

Central nystagmus may be more persistent

Provocation:

Positional nystagmus in BPPV has specific patterns based on the affected canal

Central positional nystagmus may not follow these typical patterns

Caloric Testing:

Unilateral weakness in peripheral lesions

Normal or symmetrically impaired responses in some central lesions



Fixation effect: Peripheral nystagmus typically suppresses with visual fixation, while central nystagmus often persists.

Associated symptoms: Accompanying symptoms (vertigo, hearing loss, neurological signs) help in differential diagnosis.

Time course: Acute onset vs. chronic presence can indicate different pathologies.

Provocative factors: Understanding what triggers or modulates the nystagmus is crucial for diagnosis.



Positional Nystagmus Patterns in BPPV

Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) affects three semicircular canals: posterior, horizontal (lateral), and anterior. Each canal produces a distinct nystagmus pattern when affected, which is key to accurate diagnosis.

1. Posterior Canal BPPV

Nystagmus Characteristics:

Direction: Upbeat and torsional

Torsional component: Top pole of the eye beats towards the affected ear

Provoked by: Dix-Hallpike test

Specific Pattern:

Latency: 1-5 seconds after position change

Duration: 5-30 seconds

Fatigability: Decreases with repeated testing

Reversal: Nystagmus reverses when returning to sitting position

2. Horizontal (Lateral) Canal BPPV

A. Geotropic Variant

Nystagmus Characteristics:

Direction: Horizontal, beating towards the ground in both lateral positions

Provoked by: Supine roll test

Specific Pattern:

Latency: 0-5 seconds

Duration: 15-60 seconds

Intensity: Stronger when affected ear is down

B. Apogeotropic Variant

Nystagmus Characteristics:

Direction: Horizontal, beating away from the ground in both lateral positions

Provoked by: Supine roll test

Specific Pattern:

Latency: 0-5 seconds

Duration: Can be longer, sometimes > 1 minute

Intensity: Stronger when unaffected ear is down

3. Anterior Canal BPPV

Nystagmus Characteristics:

Direction: Downbeat with a small torsional component

Torsional component: Top pole of the eye beats towards the affected ear (opposite to posterior canal)

Provoked by: Dix-Hallpike maneuver (often on either side)

Specific Pattern:

Latency: 1-5 seconds

Duration: Usually < 30 seconds

Less common and often more difficult to diagnose

Key Differentiating Features

Direction of Fast Phase:

Posterior: Upbeat and torsional

Horizontal: Pure horizontal

Anterior: Downbeat with small torsional component

Plane of Nystagmus:

Aligns with the plane of the affected canal

Latency:

Present in posterior and anterior canal BPPV

Often minimal or absent in horizontal canal BPPV

Duration:

Typically longer in horizontal canal BPPV compared to posterior or anterior

Fatigability:

All types show some degree of fatigability with repeated testing

Less pronounced in horizontal canal BPPV

Reversal:

Characteristic of posterior canal BPPV when returning to sitting position

Intensity Based on Position:

Particularly important in differentiating geotropic from apogeotropic horizontal canal BPPV

Important Considerations

Mixed BPPV involving multiple canals can occur, producing complex nystagmus patterns

Central causes of positional vertigo may produce atypical nystagmus patterns

The intensity of nystagmus doesn't always correlate with the severity of symptoms

Video-oculography can be helpful in observing subtle nystagmus patterns

Reading and interpreting VNG test graphs -  diagnosing based on VNG test results:

Ocular Motor Tests:

a) Saccade Testing:

Graph shows: Amplitude, velocity, and latency of eye movements.

Explanation: Look for:

Accuracy: Over or undershooting targets

Velocity: Too slow or fast compared to norms

Latency: Delayed initiation of saccades

Diagnosis: Abnormalities may indicate central nervous system disorders.

b) Smooth Pursuit:

Graph shows: Eye position relative to target position.

Explanation: Look for:

Gain: How closely eyes follow the target

Symmetry: Comparison between leftward and rightward pursuit

Diagnosis: Saccadic pursuit can indicate cerebellar dysfunction or CNS lesions.

c) Optokinetic Test:

Graph shows: Nystagmus in response to moving visual field.

Explanation: Assess:

Symmetry: Compare left vs. right stimulation

Gain: Strength of response

Diagnosis: Asymmetries may indicate unilateral vestibular or ocular motor dysfunction.

Positional Tests:

Graph shows: Nystagmus intensity and direction in various head positions.

Explanation: Look for:

Presence of nystagmus in specific positions

Direction and intensity of nystagmus

Latency, duration, and fatigability

Diagnosis:

Posterior canal BPPV: Up-beating torsional nystagmus in Dix-Hallpike

Horizontal canal BPPV: Direction-changing horizontal nystagmus in supine roll test

Caloric Testing:

Graph shows: Nystagmus response to warm and cool irrigation of each ear.

Explanation: Analyze:

Peak slow phase velocity for each ear and temperature

Fixation suppression

Directional preponderance

Canal paresis

Diagnosis:

Unilateral weakness: >25% difference between ears indicates peripheral vestibular dysfunction

Bilateral weakness: Reduced response in both ears

Directional preponderance: >30% asymmetry between directions

Spontaneous Nystagmus:

Graph shows: Eye position over time in central gaze.

Explanation: Look for consistent nystagmus without provocation.

Diagnosis: May indicate acute unilateral vestibular loss or central nystagmus.

Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus:

Graph shows: Nystagmus in eccentric gaze positions.

Explanation: Note direction and intensity changes with gaze position.

Diagnosis: May indicate cerebellar dysfunction or medication effects.

General Interpretation Principles:

Symmetry: Compare left vs. right responses across tests.

Consistency: Look for patterns across different test components.

Quantitative analysis: Use normative data for comparison.

Qualitative observations: Combine graph data with clinical observations.

Diagnosis Process:

Identify abnormalities in each test component.

Determine if the pattern suggests peripheral or central pathology.

Correlate findings with patient history and symptoms.

Consider common vestibular disorders that match the pattern:

Vestibular neuritis: Unilateral caloric weakness, spontaneous nystagmus

BPPV: Characteristic positional nystagmus

Meniere's disease: Fluctuating caloric responses, possible spontaneous nystagmus

Vestibular migraine: Often normal VNG, possible central-type nystagmus

Acoustic neuroma: Unilateral caloric weakness, possible central signs

Look for signs of compensation or decompensation in chronic conditions.

Consider the need for additional testing (e.g., VEMP, rotary chair) for inconclusive cases.

Remember, VNG results should always be interpreted in the context of the patient's full clinical picture, including history, symptoms, and other examination findings.

Understanding the relationship between nystagmus characteristics and specific vestibular issues is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Let's break this down systematically:

Upbeat Vertical Nystagmus: An upbeat vertical nystagmus is indeed often associated with anterior (superior) canal BPPV, not the medial canal. However, it's important to note that vertical nystagmus can also have central causes. Let's differentiate:

a) Anterior Canal BPPV:

Upbeat vertical nystagmus with a torsional component

Provoked by Dix-Hallpike test (head hanging position)

Transient and fatigable

b) Central Causes of Upbeat Nystagmus:

Pure vertical without torsional component

Often persistent

May be associated with cerebellar lesions, brainstem disorders, or medication effects

Nystagmus Types and Associated Issues:

a) Horizontal Nystagmus:

Unidirectional (beats away from affected side): Acute peripheral vestibulopathy (e.g., vestibular neuritis)

Direction-changing (geotropic): Horizontal canal BPPV

Direction-changing (apogeotropic): Horizontal canal BPPV (cupulolithiasis) or central causes

b) Torsional Nystagmus:

Combined with upbeat: Posterior canal BPPV (most common)

Pure torsional: Often central in origin

c) Down-beating Nystagmus:

Often central in origin (e.g., cerebellar dysfunction, Chiari malformation)

Rarely, can be seen in anterior canal BPPV during reversal phase

d) Gaze-evoked Nystagmus:

Bidirectional: Often central (e.g., cerebellar dysfunction, medication effects)

Unidirectional: Can be peripheral (acute phase) or central

e) Pendular Nystagmus:

Often associated with central nervous system disorders or congenital nystagmus

f) See-saw Nystagmus:

Rare, often associated with parasellar lesions or visual pathway abnormalities

Differentiating Features:

a) Fixation Effect:

Peripheral nystagmus typically suppresses with visual fixation

Central nystagmus often persists or may even be enhanced with fixation

b) Associated Symptoms:

Peripheral: Often with severe vertigo, nausea, imbalance

Central: May have additional neurological symptoms

c) Duration:

BPPV-related: Brief and fatigable

Acute peripheral: Persistent but improves over days to weeks

Central: Often persistent

d) Provocation:

Positional (e.g., BPPV): Provoked by specific head movements

Spontaneous: Present without provocation (can be peripheral or central)

e) Directionality:

Peripheral: Often unidirectional or direction-changing based on position

Central: Can be purely vertical, torsional, or multidirectional

Diagnostic Approach:

a) Careful History:

Onset, duration, provoking factors

Associated symptoms

b) Comprehensive Examination:

Ocular motor examination

Positional testing (Dix-Hallpike, supine roll test)

Neurological examination

c) VNG Testing:

Quantify nystagmus characteristics

Assess for fixation suppression

Evaluate vestibular function (e.g., caloric testing)

d) Additional Testing:

Audiometry (for inner ear disorders)

Imaging (MRI) if central cause suspected

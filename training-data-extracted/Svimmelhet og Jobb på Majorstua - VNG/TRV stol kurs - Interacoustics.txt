Course: Advances in BPPV



Notes - new trends in BPPVWith BPPV should be no other neulogoical symptoms 20-25% - up to 40% of all dizziness disorders 

90% of cases down to floating of crystals - CanalLitThiasis

10% of cases down to addering to cupila - Cupulolithiasis

BPPV can happen in all canals 95% unilateral - one direction of head movement 5% Bilateral - often with head trauma BPPV risk factors 50-70% are  Idiopathic - no known cause  Known risk factor - head trauma Inner ear disease - Meniers diseaseLow Ditamin D - 2,1x chance of development  Previus Diagnosis of BPPV - reoccurence in the first 6 months Osteoporosis 1,8x chance of development Seasonal due to lack of sun exposure - Vitamin D treatment - might reduce reoccurence rate Deteriation of Macula (Utricualar Macula) Happens with age, head injury 

Posterial canal

720 combinations for BPPV Posterial canal Devil is in the detail - needs to have the head in 45% degree  backwards in the dix hallpike



Heavy Crystals take shorter time - 30Um -  30secSmall crystals flow slower  - 10Um - 6min -  3,5um 70minTake home - If eply dont work try semont - if nether - Exercise - head shake - prolonged positioning 

The forced prolonged positioning or Vannucchi maneuver- After manuvers - have the PT do Brandt-daroff Exerices for 7-10days May me combined with prolonged positioning - Dizziness without nystagmus might still be BPPV 

- treatment Sheduale Dix halpike -> Postive -> Epley -> or semont Repeat exercise for 2x a day for 7 days Check inn week 2-3 Remission -> NO -> do Epley again Sleep on the good side Dont lay down 2h after manuver Horizontal Canal BPPV:-  Lateral canal test Turn the headin toration - flat Elevated degree bench 



BBQ Manuver for lateral - Horizontal canal 6 step turm Side - Gufoni - lateral canal BPPV 



Apogenotropic nystamus - nystamus away from side Weaker on the lesion side 





Find the Canal 

Posterior 

Dix Hallpike - to affected side 

Torsonal towards the floor of Up beat nystagmus 

Lateral - Horizontal 

Spuine elevated Roll test at 30% elevation 

Geotropic nystamus, stronges to affected side, latency, fades 

Anterior 

Dix Hallpike non-affected side 

Downbeat nystagmus 

Posterior CupuloLithiasis

Dix Hallpike - to affected side 

Torsonal towards the floor of Up beat nystagmus, weaker - but no latency or termination

Lateral CupuloLithiasis

Spuine elevated Roll test at 30% elevation 

ApoGeotropic nystamus, weaker to affected side, no latency, no termination - weaker nystag then canalolithiasis  

Anterior CupuloLithiasis

Dix Hallpike non-affected side 

Downbeat nystagmus, weaker - but no latency or termination



The bow and lean maneuver is to identify side of lesion in either lateral canal canalithiasis or cupulolithiasis



anterior canal BPPV, its diagnostic tests and treatment options

Bend over Eply - Nose 45 degree to the opposite side, then move towards the affected side in rotation

BPPV

95% of the cases Are unilateral. If bilateral head trauma is often associated. 

Risk Factors 

Hx of head trauma (increased chnache for bilateral BPPV) 

Hx of previous inner rar distanse such as vestibular neuritis or minimeres 

Age (peak incidence of frist ondet at 50 and riding Thereafter) 

Previous BPPV 

Low Vitamin D levels (2.1 times higer chance)

Osteoporose (1.8 times higer chance) 

Seasonal effekt due to lakk of sin exposure (

Recommendations: 

Vitamin D and calcium supplements 

Outdoor activities 

Dietry counselling

Lest Sidelying and Semont Maneuvers on TRV 

45 deg to the right

Quickly moved to the sidelying manouver. Head 45 deg to the left

Left semont is quickly moved to frontal sidelying. 

Horizontal manouver

Head is rotated to the each side. 

Geotropic nystagmus is stronger when afected side (ear) is down. (Canalolithiasis). Med vibrasjon blir nystagmus sterkere

Apogeotropic nystagmus is weaker to the legioner side. (Cupulolithiasis). Med vibrasjon blir nystagmus svakere.

Bow and Lean test is to identifisere side of lesion in Esther canalithiasis or cupuloithiasis. 

Canal: geotropic nystagmus

Bow: beats towards involved side, 

Lean: beats away from involved side. 

Cupulo: Ageotropic nystagmus

Bow: beats away involved side

Lean: beats towards the involved side

Vannucchi manouver is used to treat lateral/horizontal canal bppv.

Bump the chair. 

Dynamisk BQQ roll for right and left horizontal bppv

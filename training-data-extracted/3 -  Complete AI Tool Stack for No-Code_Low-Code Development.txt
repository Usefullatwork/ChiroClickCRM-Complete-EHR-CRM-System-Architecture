# Complete AI Tool Stack for No-Code/Low-Code Development



You're looking for a comprehensive AI-powered approach that lets you build an entire system with minimal coding. Here's a complete stack of AI tools that work together:



## Core AI Development Platform



### GitHub Codespaces + Copilot (Recommended Central Hub)

- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud development environment

- **GitHub Copilot**: AI pair programmer

- **Monthly cost**: $10-20/month

- **Benefits**: Centralizes development, suggests entire functions and files

- **How it helps**: Write significant portions of code by describing what you want



This becomes your central development environment where other tools can integrate.



## Complete AI Tool Stack for Development



### 1. Initial Project Setup & Structure



**AI Tool**: Claude + GitHub Copilot

- Ask Claude to generate project structure

- Copy into Codespaces

- Have Copilot fill in the implementation details

- **Example prompt**: "Create a file structure for a React therapy EHR system with patient management and SOAP notes"



### 2. UI/UX Design



**AI Tool**: Galileo AI or Visily

- **Cost**: $20-30/month

- **Purpose**: Generate complete UI designs from text descriptions

- **Example usage**: "Create a therapy SOAP notes interface with a template sidebar and main editing area"

- **Process**: Export designs to code with built-in code generators



### 3. Database Design & Management



**AI Tool**: Atlas CLI + Claude

- **Cost**: Free tier available

- **Purpose**: MongoDB setup and management with AI assistance

- **Process**: 

  1. Ask Claude for database schema design

  2. Generate CLI commands to set up database

  3. Use Prisma AI (free) to generate database code



### 4. Frontend Development



**AI Tool**: Builder.io or V0.dev

- **Cost**: $0-29/month

- **Purpose**: Generate React components from text descriptions

- **Example**: "Create a patient list component with search and filter functionality"

- **Process**: Generate, customize, then integrate into your project



### 5. Backend Logic



**AI Tool**: Pieces.app + GitHub Copilot

- **Cost**: Free tier available, $12/month for premium

- **Purpose**: AI code generation and management

- **Process**: Describe API endpoints and business logic, AI generates implementation



### 6. Mobile App Development



**AI Tool**: AppMaster.io with AI features

- **Cost**: $24-60/month

- **Purpose**: Visual app builder with AI assistance

- **Process**: Connect to your backend via API, use visual tools with AI guidance



### 7. Integration & Testing



**AI Tool**: Replit Ghostwriter + GitHub Copilot Chat

- **Cost**: $10-20/month

- **Purpose**: Help debug and integrate components

- **Process**: Ask for integration code, error fixing, and test creation



## Workflow: Bringing It All Together



Here's how to use these tools together for your therapy EHR system:



### Step 1: Project Planning with AI

1. Use Claude to create detailed plan, architecture, and requirements

2. Have Claude generate file structure and basic startup files

3. Initialize GitHub repository with this structure



### Step 2: Setup Development Environment

1. Create GitHub Codespaces environment from your repository

2. Install necessary extensions (Copilot, MongoDB, React, etc.)

3. Use Copilot to help set up development configurations



### Step 3: Database Implementation

1. Use Claude to design database schema for patients, templates, SOAP notes

2. Have Copilot generate MongoDB schema code

3. Set up connection to MongoDB Atlas



### Step 4: Backend API Development

1. Describe each API endpoint to Claude/Copilot

2. For example: "Create an API endpoint that retrieves all templates filtered by category"

3. Let Copilot generate the implementation



### Step 5: Frontend Components

1. Use Builder.io or V0.dev to generate key UI components

2. For complex components, describe them to Copilot

3. Ask Claude for help with component integration



### Step 6: Mobile App Creation

1. Use AppMaster's visual builder for mobile app

2. Connect to your backend API

3. Use AppMaster's AI features to help with logic



### Step 7: Testing & Debugging

1. Ask Copilot Chat to generate tests for your application

2. Use Claude to help interpret errors and suggest fixes

3. Use Replit Ghostwriter for interactive debugging help



## Example: Building Your Click-to-Text Interface



Here's a specific example for your therapy EHR's click-to-text feature:



1. **Design Phase**:

   - Use Galileo AI: "Create a SOAP note interface with sidebar template categories and clickable template buttons"

   - Export design to HTML/CSS



2. **Frontend Implementation**:

   - Ask Copilot: "Create a React component that allows clicking on template buttons to insert text at cursor position"

   - Use Builder.io to generate the template sidebar component



3. **Backend Implementation**:

   - Ask Claude: "Write MongoDB schema for storing clinical templates with categories"

   - Ask Copilot to implement API endpoints for template retrieval



4. **Integration**:

   - Use GitHub Copilot Chat to help combine the components

   - Ask: "How do I connect the template sidebar to the text editor component?"



## Important Considerations for This Approach



### Learning Requirements

- Basic understanding of web concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

- Ability to read and modify code suggested by AI

- Familiarity with GitHub interface



### Time Investment

- 2-3 weeks to learn the AI tools

- 3-6 months to build a functional system (vs. years for traditional coding)



### Cost Comparison

- **AI Tool Stack**: $50-100/month total

- **No-Code Platforms**: $50-200/month total

- **Traditional Development**: $10,000+ for professional developers



### Quality Expectations

- Will require iteration and refinement

- May not be as polished as professional development

- Suitable for proof-of-concept and initial versions



## Next Steps: Getting Started



1. **Create GitHub account** and enable Copilot

2. **Set up GitHub Codespaces** as your central development environment

3. **Start with small components** rather than the entire system

4. **Use Claude to generate starting code** and paste into Codespaces

5. **Let Copilot expand and complete** the code Claude provides

6. **Iterate and refine** with help from both AI tools

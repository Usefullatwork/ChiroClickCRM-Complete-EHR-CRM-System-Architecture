BOOOK STUFF BASICS 

Purpose of the Vestibular System The human vestibular system estimates body position and motion. Motion inputs to the v estibular system include the inner ear signals as well as position sensation, (“proprioception”) visual signals, and intended movement (“motor commands”). These redundant inputs are inte grated by the central processor, the “vestibular nuclear complex,” which gen erates motor commands to drive the eyes and body. 

The eye and body movement output of the central vestibular system is generally described in terms of three simple reflexes, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), the vestibulocollic reflex (VCR), and the v estibulospinal reflex (VSR). The VOR generates eye movements that enable clear vision while the head is in motion. The VCR acts on the neck musculature to stabilize the head. The VSR generates compensatory body movement to maintain head and postural stability and thereby pre vent falls.

Given sufficient time, persons with up to approxi mately 50% loss of vestibular function adapt so well that a casual observer may find them indistinguishable from someone without a vestibular lesion.



The Peripheral Sensory Apparatus Peripheral v estibular system, which lies within the labyrinth of the inner ear The labyrinth, subdivided into the bon y and membranous. labyrinths, contains the hair cells, which are the motion receptors of the vestibular system. The labyrinth is bordered laterally by the air-filled middle ear and medially by the temporal bone and is posterior to the cochlea. Bony Labyrinth The bony labyrinth consists of three semicircular canals (SCCs), the cochlea, and a chamber between the tw o called the vestibule (Fig. 1.3). The bony labyrinth is filled with perilymphatic fluid, which has chemistry similar to cerebrospinal fluid (high Na:K ratio).Perilymphatic fluid communicates via the cochlear aqueduct with cere brospinal fluid. Because of this communication, disorders that affect spinal fluid pressure (such as lumbar puncture) can also affect inner ear function.Physiology of the PeripheryThe hair cells of the canals and otoliths con vert the me chanical energy generated by head motion into neural dis charges directed to specific areas of the brainstem and the cerebellum. By virtue of their orientation, the canals and otolith organs are able to respond selectively to head mo tion in particular directions. Because of differences in their fluid mechanics, the canals respond to angular v elocity, and the otoliths to linear acceleration

Semicircular Canals The SCCs provide sensory input about head v elocity, which enables the VOR to generate an eye movement that matches the velocity of the head movement. The desired result is that the e yes remain stationary in space during head motion, enabling clear vision.



Otoliths The otoliths register forces related to linear acceleration (Fig. 1.8). They respond to both linear head motion and static tilt with respect to the gravitational axis. The func tion of the otoliths is illustrated by the situation of a pas senger in a commercial jet.

The otoliths therefore differ from the SCC in two basic ways: They respond to linear motion instead of angular motion, and their output is mainly propor tional to acceleration rather than velocity.7 The otoliths have a simpler task to perform than the canals. Unlike the canals, which convert head velocity into cupular displacement through hydrodynamic viscos ity, the otoliths need no special hydrodynamic system to do their job. Exquisite sensitivity to gravity and linear acceleration is obtained by incorporating crystals of calcium carbonate (limestone), the otoconia, into the otolithic membrane (see Fig. 1.5). Because force is equal to mass times acceleration, by incorporating a lar ge mass, a given acceleration produces enough shearing force to make the otoliths extremely sensitive. (Shearing force refers to force that is directed perpendicularly to the processes of the hair cells.)

Like the canals, the otoliths respond to motion in all three dimensions (Fig. 1.9). However, unlike the SCC of one ear, which have one sensory organ for each axis of an gular motion, there are two sensory organs for three axes of linear motion. In an upright indi vidual, the saccule is vertical (parasagittal), whereas the utricle is horizontally oriented (near the plane of the lateral SCC).



The Vestibular NerveVestibular nerve fibers are the afferent projections from the bipolar neurons of Scarpa’s (vestibular) ganglion. The vestibular nerve transmits af ferent signals from the labyrinths along its course through the internal auditory canal (IAC). In addition to the v estibular nerve, the IAC contains the cochlear nerve (hearing), the facial nerve, the nervus intermedius (a branch of the f acial nerve, which carries facial sensation), and the labyrinthine artery. The IAC travels through the dense petrous portion of the tem poral bone to open into the posterior fossa at the le vel of the pons. Note that “petrous” is deri ved from the Latin word petrosus, meaning “stone-like, hard,” and thus the inner ear is very well protected!

The vestibular nerve en ters the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction. Because the vestibular nerve is interposed between the labyrinth and the brainstem, some authorities consider this nerve a peripheral structure, whereas others consider it a central structure. We consider it a peripheral structure. There are two patterns of firing in vestibular afferent neurons. Regular afferents usually have a tonic rate and little variability in interspike intervals. Irregular afferents often show no firing at rest and when stimulated by head motion develop highly variable interspike intervals.9 Regular afferents appear to be the most important type for the VOR; irregular afferents can be turned off with electrical stimulation without much change in the VOR of monkeys.10 Irregular afferents may be important for the VSR and in coordinating responses between the otoliths and canals.



Central Processing of Vestibular InputThere are two main targets for vestibular input from pri mary afferents: the vestibular nuclear complex and the cerebellum (see Fig. 1.1). The vestibular nuclear complex is the primary processor of vestibular input and implements direct, fast connections between incoming afferent information and motor output neurons. The cerebellum is the main adaptive processor—it monitors vestibular performance and readjusts central vestibular processing if necessary. At both locations, vestibular sensory input is processed in association with somatosensory and visual sensory input



Vestibular Nucleus The vestibular nuclear complex consists of four major nu clei (superior, medial, lateral, and descending) and at least seven minor nuclei. This large structure, lo cated primarily within the pons, also extends caudally into the medulla. The superior and medial vestibular nuclei are relays for the VOR. The medial vestibular nucleus is also involved in vestibulospinal reflexes and coordinates head and eye movements that occur together . The lateral vestibular nucleus is the principal nucleus for the vestibu lospinal reflex. The descending nucleus is connected to all Figure 1.10 The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) arcs. S, L, M, and D indicate the superior, lateral, medial, and descending vestibular nuclei, respectively. The lateral vestibulospinal and medial vestibulospinal tracts are shown as heavy lines and light lines, beginning in the lateral vestibular nucleus and medial vestibular nucleus, respectively.15 the other nuclei and the cerebellum b ut has no primary outflow of its own. The vestibular nuclei between the two sides of the brainstem are laced together via a system of commissures, which are mutually inhibitory. The commis sures allow information to be shared between the two sides of the brainstem and implement the push-pull pairing of canals discussed earlier.15 In the vestibular nuclear complex, processing of the vestibular sensory input occurs concurrently with the pro cessing of extravestibular sensory information (propriocep tive, visual, and efferent (see Fig. 1.1). Extensive connections between the vestibular nuclear complex, cerebellum, ocular motor nuclei, and brainstem reticular activating systems are required to formulate appropriately oriented and timed sig nals to the VOR and VSR effector organs, the extraocular and skeletal muscles.

Vascular SupplyThe vertebral-basilar arterial system supplies blood to the peripheral and central vestibular system (Fig. 1.11). The posterior-inferior cerebellar arteries (PICAs) branch of f the vertebral arteries.





Cerebellum The cerebellum (Fig 1.12) is a major recipient of outflow from the vestibular nucleus complex and is also a major source of input itself. Although not required for vestibular reflexes, vestibular reflexes become uncalibrated and in effective when the cerebellum is remo ved. Figure 1.12A and B shows the relationship of the cerebellum to the vestibular nucleus, labyrinth, spinal cord, and ascending pathways.

The cerebellar flocculus is required to adapt the gain of the VOR.16 Adaptation is initially learned in the floc culus, maintained in “softw are,” and, after a delay , is downloaded to “hardware”—brainstem flocculus target neurons.17 Lesions of the flocculus reduce the ability of experimental animals to adapt to disorders that reduce or increase the gain of the VOR. Flocculus disorders are found typically in patients with the Arnold-Chiari Malformation or other cerebellum disorders. The cerebellar nodulus adjusts the duration of VOR responses and is also involved with processing of otolith input. Patients with lesions of the cerebellar nodulus, such as patients with medulloblastoma, show gait ataxia and often have nystagmus, which is strongly affected by the position of the head with respect to the gravitational axis. The nodulus is required for motion sickness.18
